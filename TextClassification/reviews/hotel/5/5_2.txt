Beautiful hotel with wonderful front desk and valet staff. The only down fall was housekeeping as they would always forget to replenish our towels. They would take the dirty ones and not give us any clean towels. Then when we would ask for towels they would give us one towel and two bath mats. So we'd have to call again. When they would drop it off they acted like they were doing us a favor. It would've been a favor if we were asking for extra towels, not the ones we should have had in the first place. This was the only reason I couldn't give them the excellent rating for room cleanliness and comfort.
