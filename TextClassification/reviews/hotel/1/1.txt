This was the most inconvenient and terrible experience I have ever had. When I arrived I was told my reservation had been cancelled. They refused to give me my room claiming they had no rooms available. I had already been charged on my debit card for the hotel so I could not understand why I did not have a room when I arrived. After arguing with the the Marriot receptionist for an hour and constantly calling "hotels.com" I was told that they could not give me a room but that they would get me a room at the Hilton.so then my girlfriend and I had to walk all the way to the Hilton with all of our luggage. Not only was this inconvenient but it was also embarrassing. All of this took a ridiculous amount of time which in turn made me very late for the concert that I was there to attend at the convention center. So not only did I have a terrible hotel experience they also ruined my concert experience which I had payed a lot of money for. I will not be booking through hotels.com or staying at the Marriot again. To top it all off the next day the Marriot still charged me $34 for valet parking when I had to walk back to the Marriot from the Hilton to pick up my car(again carrying all my luggage that far). Valet parking is supposed to be convenient which it was not. It would have been closer for me had I self parked.
