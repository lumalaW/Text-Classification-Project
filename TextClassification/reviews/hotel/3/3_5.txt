When we walked into our room, it smelled like urine that someone had tried to cover up with room spray. I finally found the problem, in the corner, by the TV the carpet was coming up and brown as if someone had actually peed in the corner. Then the blackout curtains were two different lengths, one went to the ground and the other was short and let sunlight in. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to change rooms as the hotel was booked. I was really disappointed in the room and the quality of my stay. The smell made it hard to stay in the room for long periods of time and the curtain issue made it hard to sleep past sunrise. The location, however, was great, but next time I'm in San Jose, I would stay at the Hilton which is right beside the convention center and light rail as well.
