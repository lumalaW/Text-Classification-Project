At 1am there were people in the hall yelling, the cops arrived and were dealing with the situation until 3am. When I asked for a late check-out they told me no, even though they were not able to handle the chaos until 3:30am. I parked my car in valley, BIG MISTAKE!! It took an hour for me to get my car.
