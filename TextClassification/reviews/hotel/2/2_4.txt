My wife and I have stayed at this property previously over the past two years the last time a year ago and we rated it very highly. Unfortunately this trip with our child wasn't a good experience. We had booked and paid for a two bed Concierge room but arriving at the property was told there no two bed rooms were available - despite our pleading and paid reservation - but a Jr. Suite was available with a pull out sofa at the same price. First tip things weren't going to go too well. Walking down the hallway to the room we encountered duct tape (sorry about the dark pic) holding the hall carpet together. Tip #2. Entering the Jr. Suite we found that it was a handicapped room featuring a no-threshold shower with a short shower curtain. Tip #3 this was going to be a unpleasant experience. Showering flooded the entire bathroom floor. Then there was a cheerleading and volleyball tourney in the convention center which packed this property and the neighboring properties with way too many energetic young ladies bouncing around at all hours. Unfortunately since our stay a year ago, outside the lobby the property has significantly 'tired' from wallpaper seams starting to un-glue, banged up and heavily scuffed walls, faded common area carpet. Couple all the above with a less than helpful, uncaring check-in person with the coupe de grace of 2 day uncleaned vomit on the sidewalk next to the drive entrance and we most likely won't return. Behind the property is $7 overnight parking.
