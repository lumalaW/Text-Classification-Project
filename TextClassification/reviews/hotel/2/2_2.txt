I am a fan of all Marriotts. I prefer to book with only big name hotels. However, I was disappointed with this one. I booked for 2/15 for a one night stay. Apparently, there were multiple weddings going on this day, as well as a volleyball tournament next door at the convention center. You would think that by the number of reservations this weekend, they would have planned to staff accordingly. WRONG. My boyfriend and I waited 45 FREAKING minutes to get valet service!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GAS I WASTED?!?!?! We were stuck in the valet traffic for THAT long and when we were finally helped, NO ONE apologized for the wait time. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! Although the hotel itself was nice and neat, the room was just OKAY. Our sink was clogged, and when it finally drained 20 minutes later, all the leftover residue of my boyfriend's shavings, my face wash, our toothpaste, and much more were left in the bowl. DISGUSTING! As we were getting ready for our night out on the town, we grabbed the ironing board. It plopped right over, because it was broken. Although the hotel itself was nice, and the location was good, I don't know if I would stay here again. Like I said, I've never experienced this at any other Marriott. In my opinion, service and cleanliness is what makes it or breaks it for me at a hotel. This specific Marriott broke it.
