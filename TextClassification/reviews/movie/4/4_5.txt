I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but this was an interesting take on the mythos. It was nice to get back to the original look and feel of the movies (none of the "Why does everything years before A New Hope look so much sleeker and cooler than the stuff that is supposedly 20-odd years later?"). And they deal well with the question of "Why didn't any of these characters show up in A New Hope? (Basically, the only way they could. Genevieve O'Reilly plays a great Mon Mothma, originally played by Caroline Blackiston in ROTJ) And I like the fact that Disney seems to really have committed to solid female leads for the series, first in Force Awakens, and now in Rogue One. Now all we need is a story line that isn't a variant on "A plucky band of misfits defeats enormous numerical odds against a galaxy-wide empire to blow up a really big thing."
