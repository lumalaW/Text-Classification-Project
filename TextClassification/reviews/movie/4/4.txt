My husband is the star wars nerd of the family so by default I am forced to watch all of the newer movies as they come out. That being said I really enjoyed rogue one. I know some of the die hard fans complained about it being a different feel than the typical star wars movies - but I didnt see that and I could see very easily how this one tied in with the original plot line. We bought the disc set that came with the digital version since we mostly just watch things with our ROKU player and we were able to redeem this using amazon.
