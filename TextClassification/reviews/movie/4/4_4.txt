I love Star Wars and I love Rogue One. Why didn't you give it five stars, you ask? The CGI for Wilhuff Tarkin is just so bad it breaks you from your period of disbelief. I appreciate they took the effort to tie the original to this se-pre-quel, but it misses the mark every single time. Was that all? No. (Spoiler alert) the CGI for Princess Leia also is missing that human touch.

And all those cool shots in the trailers? Nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Jyn saying "you're rebels. I rebel" is missing. A Tie fighter appearing into frame with Jyn doing something awesome? Gone!

That being said, the story telling is fantastic. K-2SO steals every scene. The music is okay but it doesn't envelope you the way the original themes do. And of course there's the best scene, in my opinion, of the whole franchise!!! If you haven't seen it yet, just know Darth Vader is killer!!
