The special effects was good. i grew up with the first star wars movies. I thought those actors Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford etc... had a lot more chemistry with each other maybe they were better at acting than these new actors. You really loved the characters in those movies, not so much with this movie. Maybe it was better writing too.
