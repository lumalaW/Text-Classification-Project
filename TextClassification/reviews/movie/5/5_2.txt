I can't really find any flaws with this movie, and as an avid Star Wars fan I initially watched Rogue One with a critical eye. The director really knows Star Wars and the care he took in making this movie as he did shows that he truly loves the saga. It does its part to bring the film franchise back to its roots and has a character with the most 70s Star Wars name: Cassian Andor! I watched this in the theater with my mouth agape for most of it and could watch it over and over without ever getting tired of it.
