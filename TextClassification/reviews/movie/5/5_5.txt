I don't need to describe Star Wars obsession to any fan. I've had it since 1977. And after being so terribly disappointed in the three prequels, and really not loving The Force Awakens at all, I'm over the moon after watching Rogue One. Finally we got a Star Wars movie that is not geared towards children, or just resting on the laurels of the original trilogy. The stiff-looking Tarkin and Leia CGI aside, this movie thrilled me like Star Wars did as a kid - the action, the sly humor, the excitement, the hope, the tears. The universe in the movie feels enormous, and at the same time the visual and location details of all the worlds are so fine and well done that they feel real and tangible. I loved the movie, and I love the feeling I have after the movie. I look forward to many years of obsession with Rogue One.
