I loved this Star Wars movie more than any other, with the exception of the first one released in 1977, Episode IV: A New Hope. It is exciting, thought provoking and so fun to watch all the puzzle pieces of the merging storylines come together. Masterfully created in my opinion and really takes me back to my childhood days. We saw it the day after Carrie Fisher passed and it was quite a tribute that led to a few tears in the last moments of the film.
