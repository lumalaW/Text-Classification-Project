Better than Episode VII, but that isn't saying much. Poorly written and directed, it doesn't really fit in the storyline with the original movies and actually ends up hurting them. This is what happens when you promise fans a new Star Wars movie every year. They don't have time (or take the time) to make a decent film. The only positives in this movie are a few funny lines and getting to watch a few Donnie Yen fighting scenes.
