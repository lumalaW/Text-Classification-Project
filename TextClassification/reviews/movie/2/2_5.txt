To each his own, I was 3 when A NEW HOPE premiered, LOVE episodes 4, 5, AND 6.........CAN NOT COMPARE!!! tried VERY hard to tie in the others, plot....eehhhh... you can NEVER replace Carrie Fisher or the ORIGINAL Van Helsing, Peter Cushings.....the cadence of Vader was off, I LOVE James Earl Jones, I won't hate on him but, "Disney" CAN'T get this wright!!!!!
