Hey, look, Lucasfilm has stepped up the special effects dept again...

Other than that, worst. ending. ever. I mean, seriously, total letdown. Not going to spoil it here - any internet search will turn up plenty.

Good acting from many, including a few no longer with us, but atrocious plot.

Worth a watch if you're a fan; doubt you'll need to see it twice. If you e seen the other movies, you pretty much know the core events.
