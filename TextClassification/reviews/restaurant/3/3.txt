I had everything on the menu, the pancakes, the omelet, the crab benedict, the hamburger with peanut butter, the state fair cheese curds, the drinks, almost everything that yelpers and facebookers recommended and I just wasn't impressed.  I think I placed my expectations higher than it should have and left extremely disappointed.  There was nothing memorable about my two visits here except for the great service and the hospitality that I received when I was there.  I won't sway anyone from visiting this restaurant but I was just not all that impressed.  Visit for yourself and come to your own conclusion about this popular restaurant.
