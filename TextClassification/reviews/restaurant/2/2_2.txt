Went for dinner with a coworker. Arrived at 7:10pm. Told 20min wait and gave phone number as they text when table ready which kind of cool. Tried to fine sweat at bar but no luck as everyone wanted to keep a coat or purse on the stool next to them and not the hooks provided. 20min found 2 open stools. Meanwhile counted 7 booths open and a few tables so they were trying to slow things as kitchen was slammed with what seems to be 50% full. Was able to get a drink after 10m. After 35 got the text table ready. Was walked past several 4 tops and booth and shoved in a small 2 top for 2 guys, was like really and they said this is what they had. Already hungry we took it. 

I got Cesar salad and the Jamaican pork chop cooked medium.  Salad was ok, not sure why tomato was in a Cesar but ok. Chop came and first 1/2 was okay. Not really jerk. Mashed were like warm and veggies cooked to mush. 

Wasn't until most the way through the chop I noticed it was RARE at best. Showed server and was told "oh rare poke I eat all that time." No concern, no management visited, no nothing other then "do you want desert". 

Glad I'm just visiting here as I know I'll never have to go back.
