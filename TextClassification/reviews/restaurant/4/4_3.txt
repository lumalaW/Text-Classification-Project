Hell's Kitchen is definitely a popular destination to grab a meal downtown Minneapolis for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Tried their Original crack power salad for brunch and absolutely loved it! A friend of mine recommended it and told me that the original crack salad was super popular so I was excited to try it. It was so refreshing and wholesome.
I saw the intense Bloody Mary line and opted for a Mimosa to complement my salad.

On other occasions I have had their Quesadilla was super yummy. I will say I am not fan of their homemade ketchup. They don't  have regular ketchup so I dealt with the homemade option on that one instance.

Love their partner pastry shop, Angel food bakery that is right next door.
