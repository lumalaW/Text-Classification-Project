Must-visit spot while in Minneapolis.

I enjoyed the theme and ambiance. Food was really good also.

We went at around 12pm brunch time on a Sunday on the weekend before Halloween!

Perfect, perfect, perfect all around. We enjoyed the live music.

We had the MN icons - Walleye hash, ham & pear crips and lemon-ricotta hotcake. We had the jacked up bloody mary as well. Just had to try it all.

The walleye is iconic for the area so we're glad to got to try a taste of Minnesota. This was a highlight for us. We really enjoyed the cream sauce!

The framed portraits in the bathroom were quite freaky... for me at least.

The bloody mary/mimosa bar is an experience in itself. Note for shrimp lovers that there's shrimp at the end of the bloody mary bar so make sure you make room for it in your mug. My bloody mary turned out awesome but I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you put in your glass!

Great place. I'm glad we went.
