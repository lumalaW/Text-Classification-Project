Quirky. Tasty. Friendly. Solid service with creative eats and a fun, upbeat ambiance. For Bostonians, this is Beehive meets Lolita, with better food and lesser drinks. 

HK is also chock full of things you must eat before you die, including:

In-house crunchy peanut butter (with berry jam for maximum impact

BisonSausagePattyThingFromHeaven

Hash browns crunchier than St√•le Rice Krispies on 30 seconds of milk dip. 

Bloody Mary / Mimosa bar is impressive but adds up quickly and like a carnival ride only one person per table needs to get on. 

Live music is upbeat. Patrons colorful. Decor a mashup of Poe and the Angels & Demons set. 

Great stop for unique fare, good service right in downtown Minneapolis.
