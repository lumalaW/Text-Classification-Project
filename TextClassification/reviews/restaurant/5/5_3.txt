I took a bite of the devil's food and now I'm glad to join the dark side. 

Okay, enough metaphors. I picked this restaurant on a blip because I was craving a good burger. The restaurant is located inside a building basement, which seem to be fitting the name's theme. The atmosphere is nice without going too much for the sake of the novelty of the name "Hell's kitchen". The service was friendly and timely though it looks like they can get overwhelmed pretty quickly. The wait time was decent, with a large waiting place for you to hang out and order drinks from. 

I had the standard Juicy Lucifer burger with sweet potato fries. It was one of the best SPF I had. It wasn't too sweet, which is to my liking. It comes with a pepper jelly which is on the sweeter side of chili pepper and it was highly recommended. The molten cheese almost caught me off guard but it was a satisfying lip burn. I smothered the jelly across my plate rather than dipping it. I think it's a great technique than just putting on your burger. Because of how incredibly awkward the burger stack is (the patty was almost egg shape), I ate with a fork and knife, which is fine. Hell's Kitchen is a recommended visit for Minneapolis.
