What a fun, funky, fantastic place! In Minneapolis for business and kept hearing rumors of Hell's Kitchen (not to be mistaken for Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen).

You walk down into a basement where you are immediately hit with all kinds of fun, quirky decor.

We started off with the tater tots served with blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, hot sauce and ketchup. YUMMO

My colleague had the Juicy Lucifer (Juicy Lucy) which apparently MN is known for their cheese stuffed hamburger....he was kind enough to share 1/2 with me...talk about Juicy and outright delicious!!! 

I had the filet mignon (shared 1/2 with my colleague, of course) served with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes.... all cooked and flavored to perfection.

Paired with a glass of red wine...super pleased with the meal, the wait staff and the ambiance.
