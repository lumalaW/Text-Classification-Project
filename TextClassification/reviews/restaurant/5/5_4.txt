Wow...is what my wife and I think about this place. We were walking around the downtown area a stumbled across this place and decided to give them a shot and we defiantly made the right choice.  I order the French dip and fried cheese curds and my wife ordered the walleye tacos. My French did was flavored perfectly and the cheese curds were awesome...on problem was my wife was stealing them off my plate! The walleye tacos were amazing. They had a beautiful balance of sweet, salty, spicy and tartness. They were well rounded and difficult to stop eating. I wanted to go back the next day, but we decided to give another restaurant a shot...I wish we went back! Staff was was great, our server gave us the perfect amount of attention!
