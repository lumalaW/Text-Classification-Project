This place was good year's ago and now I think it's made the owner's head to big to notice that he has folks working for him that don't treat the customers right and can't get orders right either.  This really ruined my experience at this place.  Food was good, but it came super late and wrong.  The waiter, who did not write anything down, tried to tell me what I ordered in a very snotty matter and I did not appreciate that.  He also told me that because they he had to change the order it would take longer. LONGER?!!  He mentioned that he had been there for 17 years, but methinks he needs a new career as our experience was a disaster!!
