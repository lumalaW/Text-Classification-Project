Well. Was very optimistic due to all of the other reviews, so we eagerly went this am. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. First we sat for nearly 10 minutes before being greeted by a server. It was not very busy. The menu was interesting, but for a breakfast place, they are trying a little too hard to be eclectic for eclectic's sake. The coffee was not very good. I ordered the huevos rancheros with the pulled pork. Sounded amazing.  Was not. Was lukewarm and not very savory. My wife got the veggie omelet which was advertised with jalape√±os, tomatoes and onion. Good enough. Yuck. It came out with undercooked butternut squash and large pieces of undercooked carrot. In an omelet. Ewww. Who eats that? Root veggies in an omelet? The waitress apparently thought it was a mistake, but when the manager came out he simply threw the waitress under the bus and said it was her fault. Still not sure why. But when we asked him if we could simply have an omelet with tomato and peppers, he said we couldn't because of they way they prepare. Really? A restaurant that clearly has tomatoes and peppers and clearly makes omelets couldn't make one with tomatoes and peppers? Find that very disappointing. Not sure what all of the god reviews were from. Our experience was much less than spectacular.
