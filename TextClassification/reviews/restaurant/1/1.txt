You must be kidding with this place. Came because of some reviews.... which is a statement to the fact that you cant rely on reviews alone. Feels like sitting around with the bar crowd still there from the night before.... 

Place smells like old bar smell.... So why didn't we walk out? The reviews, people were nice and the menu was intriguing so had to stick it out. Benefit of the doubt sort of thing. 

Ordered the Classic Benedict which actually came out as ONE EGG Benedict.... Benedict Arnold.... owner - Tell me, what is "classic" about a single egg  on half an English muffin? What do you do with the other half??? Asked waitress who said they used to serve two but because of the size - bigger... they went to one... um... there was one standard egg on a regular muffin... what is bigger except the ham was thicker sliced... ? Seriously?? Served with the most dismal dollop of hash browns.... coffee - forget about it... rancid stuff.  13 bucks for half a benny? Cmon...

So, from professional chef to another and the owner, .... what the hell? Never again. Going to the hen house up the street.. cheers!
