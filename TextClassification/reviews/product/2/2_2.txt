I'm still offended by Apple playing the SLR card.

Even the iphone 6 at its 8MP actually looks better than the iphone 7 at 12MP for macros, and other outdoor shots.

The stabilization added in the 7 will help but in any form of action shot, it would be blurry and under low light indoors, all iphones are quite poor.

I doubt we'll see a xenon flash on the iphone 8, perhaps the 9? This of course leaves the Lumia 1020 pureview 41mp a superior shot and actually the stabilization is better there too. Alas, there is not always an app for that, with windows mobile.

If you have an older iphone, wait it out. Grab a pentax q-s1 for cheap and fun shots (along with a wifi SD card).
