The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology? Not quite.
This phone IS advanced but fragile. AppleCare and insurance is a necessity.
Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work.
I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!! Big bummer!!
It's not Steve Job's apple anymore but I can't see another device that appeals!!!
