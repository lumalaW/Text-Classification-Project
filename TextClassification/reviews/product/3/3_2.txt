The long wait is over and the iPhone 7 is here any ready to be played with. The phone is very similar to the 6s model in the outside appearance. The phone itself is water resistant, but we noticed that it can be used completely under water without a case. The phone is very durable and can be dropped. After dropping it a few times, the screen is still together, not cracked or shattered. The battery life on the new 7 is very impressive, we can go an entire day without recharging.
Even thou on specs it shows that the 7 has much better hardware, I've noticed that it lags often and at times has no response what so ever for a few seconds.
The phone does not come with a head phone jack, sure most people have Bluetooth but when I'm sitting at an appointment waiting for the doctor, I usually don't have wireless headphone with me so can't watch YouTube or play games. The display looks exactly like the 6s, I cannot tell the difference with my eyes.
Overall I was expecting more from a $900 phone. I can give it only 3 stars as there are just not many new features and there are plenty of phones with much better specs at a fraction of the price.
