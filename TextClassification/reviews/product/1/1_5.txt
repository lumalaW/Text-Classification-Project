Something wrong here.....Do your homework before you order from this seller...... there is something strange going on here. The phone arrived and would not accept the SIM card...the phone was already set up (weird....never seen this before) and would not accept the SIM card. Calls to AT&T revealed that the IMEI numbers don't match on the box and the phone.....these number must match.......AT&T tells me that the numbers I'm giving them are for an iPhone 6s Plus......not the iPhone7 that I have in my hand.....you think that's weird right? Me too.... the home button doesn't work and the whole thing is really strange.... something fishy going on here?!

The IMEI number MUST match the one on the phone.....MUST...... if u buy one of these from this seller.....your not doing ur homework. I sent mine back and drove straight to the nearest Apple Store
