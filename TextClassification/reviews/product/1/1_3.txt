I have owned strictly androids, until I was forced into an iPhone for work. I have had a 5, 6s plus, and now, the 7. When I got so mad at the poor functionality of the 6, and after smashing and breaking it, i got the 7, thinking it was a superior phone. Well, compared even to the 6, and the horrible LG line up that they've had their entire time as a smart phone manufacturer, the 7 is literally a pile of garbage.

Here is what is right with it:
- The camera. It works. The 6 was better.

That's it. Here's what's wrong with it:
- Freezes randomly in the middle of a task
- Randomly closes me out of apps
- Not smooth, fluid functionality
- Voice to text is laughably worse than Android. Before the latest iOS update, that was one of the only things I preferred about the iPhone over an Android. Now, apple has nothing.
- Maps is a joke
- The home button is also a joke. In order to do a reset, you have to hold the power and volume down key, which in turn turns your volume down. Because that couldn't be programmed to operate differently.
- Who needs a headphone jack? Not the 7, apparently. Now you have to buy a separate $25 piece to listen to music.
- Overall cheap feel.
- Autocorrect. What? You typed "of"? You obviously meant "if".

I could go on and on about how terrible this phone is. But, I think you get it. I have put in a request at work to get back into a 6, because of how terrible this phone is. Out of the nearly two dozen phones I've owned over my lifetime, this stands at my number one spot for worst phone available to major providers over the last 15 years. I have also been to the three major providers (Tmobile, att, and Verizon), and have had a huge array of different kinds of phones. I say with confidence, that this is the worst phone I have ever had the stress, and displeasure of using.

Buy at your own risk. These phones are terrible.
