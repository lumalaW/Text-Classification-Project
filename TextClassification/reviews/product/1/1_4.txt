The operating system is still not finished and it takes more than 10 minutes to establish a wi-fi connection. Whether at home or at the office or a public hot spot I find myself waiting for up to 15 minutes to get a WiFi data connection. Apple tech support people are clueless about networking devices and have recommended deleting all network connections which did not help or doing a full reset of the phone which wasted 2 days to download everything all over again and still did not help.

Updates are more than 1GB for the operating system and over 2GB for iTunes which is needed to do any sort of backup from the iPhone to a computer and Apple's trying to force everything through iTunes is as dumb a design as Microsoft's reliance on the registry.

Strongly recommend buying an Android OS based smartphone like the Pixel from Google. The Apple smartphone operating system leaves a lot to be desired if you want to connect to the internet or a local LAN and not rely 100% on cellular data with its high cost and slow speeds.
