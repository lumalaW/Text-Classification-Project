I got this as a gamble. Its hard to buy a phone online, but i read the reviews and everyone else seemed pretty pleased. I got the phone pretty quickly, opened it up, and it was exactly as described. Looked pretty much like a brand new phone and functions perfectly. I saved a lot of money and got a great deal.
