Not an insane improvement over the 6 but the addition of water resistance is great (and long overdue). I'm not a fan of the omission of the headphone jack. This is especially an issue when you want to use the adapter to use your own headphones but also want to charge the phone at the same time (i.e. long flight while watching movies). There is an adapter that will allow headphones AND charge at the same time (and this is what Apple should of included with the phone) you can check it out here: http://amzn.to/2cutG5W
