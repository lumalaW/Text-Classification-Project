I chose this hotel due to the closeness to the San Jose Center for Performing Arts. There were other hotels also close to the venue. The room was typical hotel room with flat screen tv, mini frig, tea and coffee maker.Clean room, quiet. Once of pluses to this hotel is the restaurant ,Arcadia. A Michael Minna restaurant, Steakhouse. Great service,delicious food. I intend to try the restaurant for breakfast. There is only valet parking for $39, or you can use the public parking lot down the street. There is a gift shop/ mini mart/ coffee shop near the front desk. There is a charge for wi fi, but if you are a Marriott rewards member, it's free,
