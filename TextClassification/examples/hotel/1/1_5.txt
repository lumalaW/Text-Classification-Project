They overbooked the hotel and their idea of compensating the overbooked guests was to put us up in a 2 star(at best) motel. They didn't bother to even try to contact any of us ahead of time to let us know they misrepresented that rooms had been reserved for us. I travel a lot and will not spend another dime at any Marriott hotel. "Reserve" a room at this hotel at your own risk, but plan on staying at a motel with outside facing doors, window a/c units and lots of noise including police sirens, car alarms and people yelling in the middle of the night.
