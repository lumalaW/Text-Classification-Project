I was in the shower and the toilet overflow flooding the room. I had to wade through ankle deep water to get ready and run to an 8am meeting. I called the hotel GM "Mark" and left a detailed voicemail explaining the situation thinking he would call back and at least comp the room. No call back no nothing. I have over 200,000 Marriott rewards points and a black card. Super upsetting to say the least from a lifetime customer's perspective.... unreal.
