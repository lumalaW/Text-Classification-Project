The TV didn't work each time I turned it on. I had to call maintenance to get the signal to work. The excuse I got was that they were upgrading their Hi def. Room service was fact, pleasant and efficient. Service in the restaurant was pitiful. Pancakes were raw, the omlete was no where near what I requested. We sat next to a couple who said order beverage now because you can't be sure it will arrive. They asked 4x for juice and never got it.
