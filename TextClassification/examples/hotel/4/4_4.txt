My co worker and I arrived at 11:00pm on a Sunday night. We went to a hair show at the convention center on Monday. We called and asked for a bottle of wine and were told that we were unable to get one. The bar wasn't closing until 12am. I think they could of been more accommodating. Other than that the room was clean and comfortable.
