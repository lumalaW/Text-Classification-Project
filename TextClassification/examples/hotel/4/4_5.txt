SJ Marriott does many things well. Many long-time staff who are trained to provide excellent customer service are on hand. Common areas and room were clean and well-kept. Room size a bit on the small size, especially for the rather high price of the room. A complimentary bottle or two of water would have been much appreciated at this price point. Area is groovy and urban, lots of restaurants and convention center is connected via sky-walk.
