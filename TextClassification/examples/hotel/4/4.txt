Comfortable hotel in the heart of the city It was my first time to go to San Jose with my family.We have chosen Marriot Hotel because of its's good reputations. We were not mistaken. The staff was courteous, competent & helpful. The room was impressive because of its's cleanliness, and it was also spacious, with a nice view of the surrounding buildings. We were able to get an extra bed to accommodate 4 people in the room.We had a wonderful stay in this hotel & I will recommend it to my friends.
