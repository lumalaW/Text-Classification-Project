The hotel was nice but the services seem lacking. No breakfast is available unless you do room service. As we were there for a festival with tickets to various shows it was not possible to grab a sandwich or salad for lunch before a performance or schedule a family breakfast for 11 people on site. we had to leave the hotel and plan time to go elsewhere for simple things. The cost per night seemed high when there is no self parking and a $31 charge to valet per night.
