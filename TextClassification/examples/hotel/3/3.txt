The room was nice but there was some serious construction going on at the main entrance and also at the elevators, which made it difficult to get an elevator that went down to the first floor. The hotel seemed rather boring, there was really no way to tell where anything was, not great signage or advertising once you step in. The bathroom is really nice and big, and the shades they had in the room was really good at keeping the heat out when the sun was beating on that side of the building. The bed was comfortable, and the room is clean. We had room service to days in a row. Very average breakfast yet extremely expensive. Parking at the hotel is $31 per day, and if you don't like that you can go park somewhere else in the neighborhood for roughly the same price.
