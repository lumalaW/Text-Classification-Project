Nice hotel but for $400 a night I could have stayed somewhere more nicer. This would be a great place to stay on business but not for pleasure. The front desk also over charged my credit card bye over $1,0000 dollars and it effect my bank balance and we were unable to use our debit card for 2 days. This is completly unexceptable
