As someone who watched the original Star Wars in the theatre probably 7 times, I never thought I'd say it, but didn't like this movie at all. The last movie with BB8 and the wonderful actors kept us entertained. This totally bored us. My daughter mentioned she shut it off and I just ignored her comment. Guess what we shut off mid way? Sure wasn't a normal Star Wars, it was so dry and long and dark. Did love the Robot with the attitude and the blind man. Wish more of those characters were in the movie.
