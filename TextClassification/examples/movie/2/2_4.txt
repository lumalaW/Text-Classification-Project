Rogue One is completely unoriginal. This could have been a prequel that introduces an entirely new view of the Star Wars universe. This could have been mind-blowing science fiction. Instead, the film borrows heavily from previous franchise productions and also employs cliches from other classic movies- and TV shows. This is another plot about a daughter avenging her parent's death to right a wrong. We have the character of K-2SO that is basically 3CPO in a tall, lanky, cylon-like body. We have Master Po from Kung Fu incarnated into the character of Chirrut Imwe, the blind, Jedi master. The casting of Forest Whitaker and Jimmy Smits seemed jarring and almost silly. They are so recognizable that the performances seemed more like cameos. The mantra, "I am one with the force and the force is with me," chanted during Chirrut Imwe's brave run to "flip the lever" and save the day, had me responding with "Never give up, never surrender." -And by the way, I'm confident that the real Master Po would have flipped that lever without ever going near it. There is a shot where our heroes are sneaking into the Imperial facility that looks eerily similar to the witch's castle in the Wizard of Oz complete with flying monkeys in the form of Imperial fighters. The penultimate cliche is when Jyn must transmit the Death Star plans by climbing an impossibly high, functionally ill-designed tower, replete with the 'bunch of choppy, crushy things" Galaxy Quest's Gwen DeMarco despised so much. (SPOILER ALERT) Finally, the film concludes with all of the hero characters donning their "red shirts" to needlessly sacrifice themselves for "hope." What a disappointment.
