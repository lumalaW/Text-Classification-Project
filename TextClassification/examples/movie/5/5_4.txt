Many Bothans died to bring you this review. The movie it self was done cinematic-ally well, the story line was well written and graphically it brought distant worlds right into your home.But this movie along with other Star Wars movies hold a deep place near to my heart. I can remember watching "A New Hope" eps IV with my father and mother at the drive in (yes I just aged myself LOL). So when this movie came out it brought back all those old feelings so for that alone I must give this 5 stars. But like I said it was also done as a proper Star Wars movie should be done.
