Typical corny virtual cartoon with loud chase and war scenes. Banality prominently displayed here in all the destruction and space war scenes. Not one of the best of the Star Wars series. I became bored with wasted time on the war scenes. I could leave the room and come back and not miss anything other than some computer generated graphic scenes for the sake of drama and loud music and sound effects. Choppy brief dialogue and over dramatize one liners.
