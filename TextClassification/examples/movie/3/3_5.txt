A reasonably entertaining movie, worth a view, but not the kind that I'll revisit repeatedly out of nostalgia for the franchise. Others will get into in-depth break downs of where this Star Wars themed war-movie went well and went wrong, but suffice to say, the cheese-factor inherent to the franchise here is largely masked by the grittier feel of thing.

While the blind warrior monk character was intriguing, as well as his touching friendship with the "big-gun" character, he felt abrasively shoe-horned in. The movements, choreography of his fights was too on the nose for a Chinese based action movie and honestly a bit of a distraction from the Star Wars theme. It was just a bit too "earth 2016" and distracted from the whole "Galaxy far, far away." The character himself was fantastic though, so worth the oversight imo.
