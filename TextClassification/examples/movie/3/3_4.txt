If I was going to write a movie between the 3rd and the 4th movie it would have, at some level, shown Vader killing off more Jedi and showing his power and the reason he is so feared in the 4th movie. When did Jedi start chanting? They are not wizards or witches so why are they chanting? I really thought the android and human interaction could have used more banter and some comic relief in this movie. For these reasons I rate this movie only 3 stars. Disney has yet to produce a star wars that episode that is impressive in cartoon or movie. It just isn't too great.
