The movie has its flaws and to be honest, if you're looking to purchase this you already saw this in the theater and have no need for a movie review. As far as bonus content goes it's the usual behind the scenes featurettes. Some of it is interesting and some of it is just the actors giving 'interview' answers for the puff pieces. There are no deleted or alternate scenes included like the bonus content included with the Force Awakens. I was very interested in seeing the alternate and deleted scenes that we all got a taste of in the trailers for this movie. Sadly they were not included in the digital HD version.
