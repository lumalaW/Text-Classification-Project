Even though its presented in 21:9, it is not native 21:9 (2560x1080) but is 1920x1080 with black bars making up much of that vertical 1080 resolution, black bars top and bottom, as well as left and right, unless you use the zoom feature on your 21:9 or wider TV or monitor... Many movies are native 21:9 format on Amazon, and it should be stated before you buy, whether it is or not.
