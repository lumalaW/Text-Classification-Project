Not a good serial entry, like The Force Awakens. Travel is too fast. Only one interesting scene of the Death Star 1 battlestation's superlaser being lowered in to its crater. A female protagonist, much like Rey from TFA. Recreation in CGI of the long deceased actor Peter Cushing. Too much action and too juvenile of a plot. Disney acquisition. Uninteresting and unnecessary soundtrack.
