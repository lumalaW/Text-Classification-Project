So incredibly boring and pointless. I laughed out loud when I saw CGI general tarkin, are they kidding me? Just unbelievable how they continue to basically rip off the originals and dangle shiny objects in front of us like we're cats, instead of making a serious and original Star Wars film. Rogue One is not a fun movie, I didn't really like Force Awakens but at least that one was more fun than this. This is just boring and totally and completely a waste of time.
