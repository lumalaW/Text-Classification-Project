When i was growing up in the late 70s star wars was my life. Everything I did was star wars, whether it was playing outside and pretending to be someone from star wars ~ the way kids in the 50s used to play cops and robbers or perhaps cowboys and Indians. If I was not outside playing star wars, then I was inside setting up star wars characters on one side of the room ~while my brother set up characters on the other side of the room- and we played this game with rubber bands and 3 pronged rules to shoot the rubber bands at them: last one with a star wars character standing wins.

Then in the 80s collecting all the cards and the cool toys. It was a boys dream come true. Well not anymore, star wars is all about some politically correct crap that I cant get behind nor care about. What took Luke years to master, took a woman hours, I guess their just better @ everything. And this movie, rouge one, was like watching a WW2 movie with star wars characters and star wars logos in it. Was like watching saving ryans privates meshed with star wars some how. Its just a fast pace non-thining pop corn movie.

Oh well, so much for good story telling. I miss you George Lucas, yes -Jar Jar binks was horrible and the ewoks too, but it was tolerable. Now its all about these new Disney movies with their non stop action (no time for a plot, tyvm) for the Ritalin raised kids now adults with attention deficit disorders. Meh, my time has passed, its yours now. Have fun with it, I know I did.
