Easily the weakest film of the Star Wars series. Little character development, as DIsney knew beforehand the fates of everyone would ultimately be death, so they didn't flesh out the characters.
The only remotely redeeming factor of the movie is the end, that's it. Darth Vader's sequence is the only reason I won't petition Amazon for a 0-star review for this movie.
