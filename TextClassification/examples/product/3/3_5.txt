Good : 1) dual lens zoom and 2) fingerprint sign in are more useful and convenient than I expected.

Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies. As a photographer/shutterbug, I was very disappointed. The so called 'natural' colors make pictures boring and ugly. Trees and grass have dull dirty green. Selfies skin tones are yellowish, brownish and unhealthy looking, like there's jaundice. Wrinkles are pronounced. Lens has a face widening, fattening effect. Lens distortion. For these reasons I am considering of selling my 7+ for a Samsung S8+. 7+'s Low light is terrific for a camera phone. But when I read it is DSLR level, nonsense. When other cameras phones give beautiful pictures, selfies, have beautifying software, iphone 7 is left in the dust. Pictures and selfies to many consumers are VERY important.

Minimal VR support. Another reason I am thinking of selling the phone for a Samsung. Even though Samsung is not a nice company.

7+ uses LCD screen when even my mid range Samsung J7 has OLED and much deeper blacks. Iphone 7+ screen is beautiful but the blacks are not as deep.

Not much technological and design innovation. Just a nice 'luxury' item. Apple needs to up their game.
