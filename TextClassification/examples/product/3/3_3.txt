This did not work with a UK SIM or a Bermuda SIM. Went to Apple Store in London who said to activate iphone with an iTunes restore. This did not work either - message that the SIM carrier was not supported always appeared. After reading reviews on here bought a cheap AT&T SIM which seemed to activate the phone but still did not unlock it as it was still locked for using other country SIM cards. I requested an unlock code from AT&T website 2 days ago as a last ditch attempt. They replied today and said they had approved the unlock and to go ahead and activate the phone.
It now works with a non-U.S. SIM card finally so I am hoping it is unlocked for all GSM carriers worldwide.
So the phone I received was actually not international unlocked but locked on to AT&T - even though it was described as factory unlocked for use worldwide.By the way when I contacted the Amazon Supplier they were extremely unhelpful.
