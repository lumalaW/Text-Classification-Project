I have to say, this is a good phone but it's basically a 6s without a phone jack. Same display as the 6s. The camera is better, so that's good news for camera peeps. Overall, the phone is getting the job done, but for the price, I'd say, if you already have a 6s, you can skip the 7 and save almost a $1000.
