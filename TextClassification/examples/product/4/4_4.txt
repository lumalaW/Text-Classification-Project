Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone.
