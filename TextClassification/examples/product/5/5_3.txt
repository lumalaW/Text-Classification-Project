What can I say? Fantastic updated version of the iPhone. Everything I expected and more. Ordered the unlocked int'l version in order to use it in Iceland and it works very fine. Brilliant camera. Also, recommend buying the waterproof case for taking pics on the beach or in the aqua parks, has come in handy on our honeymoon in the Canary Islands.
