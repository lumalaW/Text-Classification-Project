I just replaced my delicate ultra thin iPhone 7 after it fell from the dashboard onto the floor of my car. A mounting bracket that held it in place failed. The phone died. It had been protected with a thin plastic case. The iPhone 7 I use is supplied by my office, so I don't have a lot choice.

Our IT Department replaced the dead phone and provided a behemoth of a plastic a case to protect it. The new heavy case barely fits in my pocket

If this delicate flower of an iPhone 7 requires a massive plastic out case to survive ordinary use, perhaps Apple should reconsider it basic design.
