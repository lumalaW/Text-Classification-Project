The new iPhone 7 by apple is the best of the apple phones by far. Apple has added a few features to the phone such as the vibrating home button, a better camera with 14 mega pixels for the back and 7 mega pixels for the front. With not much change in the phone design but a few, apple stepped up with the software up date adding new texting feature and just giving the phone a new look software wise. But honestly when it comes down to it, the 7 is similar to the 6 in multiple ways and this makes me wish that apple would of done a better job at redesigning the new iPhone. I would recommend apple to anyone due to the dependability of their phones but keep in mind that with new releases of this phone might bring some disappointment.
