Dont buy this item... Received today and I dont understand if I have purchased an iPhone or an Android. It brings Android software and it looks very very cheap!
Will add photos for you to all can see it. Just looking them its enough to understand its not an iPhone 7.
It works very slow, the language is randomly changing between apps, it doesnt even have a good battery!
The serial number in the phone its not the same that the the one on the box.
Its not fair, I will find a way to return it because I dont live at USA.
ABSOLUTELY NOT RECCOMENDED, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
