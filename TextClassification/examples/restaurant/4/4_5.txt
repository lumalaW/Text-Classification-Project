Make sure you get reservations! This place gets really crowded. I had the Walleye BLT and shared the lemon ricotta hotcakes. The Walleye BLT was great and HUGE. Nice crunch on the flaky fish, bacon was perfectly cooked, and the sourdough was a nice starch to tie it all together. I was not a fan of the lemon ricotta hotcakes. It was dense.. way too much ricotta; not the light fluffy pancakes I typically enjoy. Overall, a decent place to grab lunch!
