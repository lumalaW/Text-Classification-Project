Tried this spot after the  Vikings game this past weekend on the recommendation of a friend who raved about it. And it didn't disappoint. Cool spot underground in downtown Minneapolis. We sat on the bar side. Really cool d√©cor. They have a good tap selection of local Minnesota craft beers, and a special "secret beer" for $2 each day where you don't know what you are getting until it is served. My buddy Bob tried ordering it but was swayed not to by our waiter as he noted "it wasn't very good and your not going to like it". Cheers to honesty!

I had a pint of the Summit Brewing seasonal and went for the Ham & Pear Crisp Sandwich with a side of tater tots. So good. The website menu description says it all: " Featured in "50 Best Sandwiches in America." Shaved, slow-roasted smoked pit ham, poached pears, melted Swiss and Fontina cheese on spicy-sweet buttered & grilled sourdough bread.". It was fantastic. Their homemade ketchup was amazing for dipping the perfectly crispy tots, although their homemade hot sauce lacked any sort of heat which was a tad odd for a sauce named "Bottled Hell" made at a place called "Hells Kitchen".

Great service, cool spot, good food. What more do you want?
