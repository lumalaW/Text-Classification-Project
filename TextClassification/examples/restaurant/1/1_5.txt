I suspect someone complained about seeing the slightest hint of pink in a burger once, because even if you order medium rare you'll get well-done. Poor, inattentive service from the staff (across the board, not just our waiter). The supposedly infamous homemade peanut butter is just peanut butter that's made of actual peanuts (no sugars added) - you can find this at any Whole Foods. It's nothing to come here for. 

Other dishes at the table lacked flavor and were greasy. This place is nothing special, which is disappointing after seeing over a thousand positive reviews.
