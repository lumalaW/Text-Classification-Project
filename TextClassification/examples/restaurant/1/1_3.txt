This place was absolutely terrible.  Went to dinner here last Monday night with my son and neither of us barely touched our food.  I had fish and chips (walleye)...who can screw that up?  OMG...it was the worst fish I have ever eaten.  The breeding was a quarter inch thick and way over done...the flavor was bad too.  Ok, put the fish aside for a minute...can you say COLD sweet potato fries.  My son's regular fries were also cold, and his French dip was soggy and cold.

Totally not sure how this place gets 4 stars, but you couldn't pay me to eat in this basement "hell hole" again!
