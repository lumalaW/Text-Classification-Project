Super pleased with our visit here mostly because of our server (Shannon)

We sat by the bar and were served promptly by her.  My wife is an extremely picky (annoying) eater and went through painstaking detail trying to configure her meal. Shannon hung in there through the bitter end never once exhibited frustration, confusion or hurrying her to wrap it up.  She was pleasant, friendly, positive and fun.  

The staff can make or break your experience in a restaurant...this was evidenced by our visit to Hell's Kitchen...it left us with a very favorable view of the restaurant, the city and its people.
