Not the Hell's Kitchen you think it is.

Be prepared to take yourself away from heaven and enter below the tunnel to Hell. The decor will constantly remind you of all the sins you've made. With the addition of live music, it feels as if your sins are coming alive. As creepy and cool this place is, the food is what brings you back to life. 

On to the food, the locals were right. Hell's Kitchen has the best food.

Pan fried walleye with veggies and mashed potatoes. 
Lemon ricotta pancake.

Walleye was on point and the veggies and mashed potatoes were delish. The dish was simple but the flavors were deep. Their famous lemon ricotta pancake was fluffy and sweet and filled with delightful fruits. 

I'm pretty glad there was no Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen. 

Double thumbs up for breakfast, brunch, dinner, happy hour, or games.
