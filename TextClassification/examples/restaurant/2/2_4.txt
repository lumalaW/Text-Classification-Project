I write this review with a heavy heart. I absolutely love the food here; the sauce served with our cheese curds last night was dynamite! However the last two times I have dined here I have had a terrible time. 
Both times I made reservations. 
The first time I had made a reservation months in advance for Valentine's day, yet was seated within elbow's length on both sides between other patrons. It was not at all an intimate dinner, as we could hear the conversation from both of the tables beside us. Perhaps this is "to be expected," for that day but one should always hope for the best especially when time was taken towards preparation. 
The second time we were seated with our menus for near twenty minutes before our server even came to get our drink order. Not even an acknowledgement from our server or any of the staff, a "just a moment," would have been sufficient for me to dismiss it as them just being busy. I've worked in the customer service industry for years and I'm just baffled. Just to top that off my hotcakes were served without a fork.  
This is quite unfortunate as I so enjoy the food and never had any bad experiences at the now closed Duluth location. It needs to be said, however,  I have never felt so ignored in a restaurant.

TL;DR: The food is delicious, the live band was great, but the service is lousy; and personally due to these experiences I've dubbed "Hell's Kitchen" as simply not worth the drive.
