I came here for breakfast, as Hell's Kitchen was one of the few restaurants near where I was staying that serves breakfast on the weekdays.

The place is massive.  There are two floors and the restaurant is very spacious - perfect for private parties and large groups.  I was seated immediately on a Monday morning in a dining area where there were a few other groups dining in.  My server was very friendly and helpful - and service was good. 

But the food was unsatisfactory.  I ordered the Bison Egg Benedict and substituted the hashbrowns for a mixed greens salad.  The bison benedict was drowning in the lukewarm jalapeno-hollandaise sauce, so was hard to eat, but I was mostly disappointed with the bison itself.  The menu indicated that it would be cooked to medium-rare, which is how I prefer my meat, but it unfortunately, was overcooked - so the texture was rough to cut and chew.  I was not impressed.  At least the poached egg had that runny yolk once I cut into it, and did like the greens with a pear vinaigrette, making the dish lighter.  But I would not recommend this dish, given the overcooked bison, drenched in the hollandaise sauce.      

Glad they have a breakfast menu on the weekdays, but can't say I'd willingly come back.
