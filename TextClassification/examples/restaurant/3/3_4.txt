Work lunch! So automatically this review is at a disadvantage because I would have rather been somewhere else, with other people. 

Nonetheless.... the menu looked promising. Oooh lemon pancakes! Alas, a work lunch. The others order salads, so what kind of professional would I be if I got pancakes!? So I made the mature choice and went with a grilled panini with pear or apple (couldn't tell) and some kind of white cheese. Which was okay.I didn't think it was anything special and I would not get it again. 

Service was prompt. The place is cool and I can see why people like it. I think I just made a bad choice. (Note: if there are bad choices on the menu, selection should be thinned down so everything they do is good. Jussayin.)
