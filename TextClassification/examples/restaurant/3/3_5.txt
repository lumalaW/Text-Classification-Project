The door man of the hotel recommended this place. It was noon and I had slept in, worked out and wanted coffee and breakfast. He said they serve breakfast late and it was only a few blocks from my hotel. 

You walk downstairs to a dark room. It's got a cool vibe to it and in the restaurant I sat next to a stage and on the screen they were showing cartoons. 

I was in desperate need of coffee and the waiter served that right away. I love eggs benedicts. Here you only get one so you have to upgrade if you want too. I thought it was a bit expensive for two eggs. I think I've gotten into the habit of comparing my bene's to Snooze in Denver. These were good but not in the ranking of my favorite bene's. The service was great and he offered a lot of coffee re-fills.
