Meh, I really wanted to love this place but just couldn't. 

I ordered the Juicy Lucifer, medium with tots and a side salad. This sounded amazing but turned out to be less that remarkable. The burger was a little overcooked but not to horribly, however the burger was extremely dry. This I couldn't understand since it was jam packed with cheese. But never the less it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth and was less than enjoyable. The salad was really good yet simple and the tots never showed up to the table. I gave up on asking.

Beer selection was pretty good and a few others had cocktails within our party and were satisfied. If the burger wasn't $15 and pretty bad I probably would have gave them 4 stars as the building is very interesting and so is the staff.
