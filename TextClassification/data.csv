"This was the most inconvenient and terrible experience I have ever had. When I arrived I was told my reservation had been cancelled. They refused to give me my room claiming they had no rooms available. I had already been charged on my debit card for the hotel so I could not understand why I did not have a room when I arrived. After arguing with the the Marriot receptionist for an hour and constantly calling ""hotels.com"" I was told that they could not give me a room but that they would get me a room at the Hilton.so then my girlfriend and I had to walk all the way to the Hilton with all of our luggage. Not only was this inconvenient but it was also embarrassing. All of this took a ridiculous amount of time which in turn made me very late for the concert that I was there to attend at the convention center. So not only did I have a terrible hotel experience they also ruined my concert experience which I had payed a lot of money for. I will not be booking through hotels.com or staying at the Marriot again. To top it all off the next day the Marriot still charged me $34 for valet parking when I had to walk back to the Marriot from the Hilton to pick up my car(again carrying all my luggage that far). Valet parking is supposed to be convenient which it was not. It would have been closer for me had I self parked.",hotel
"I was in the shower and the toilet overflow flooding the room. I had to wade through ankle deep water to get ready and run to an 8am meeting. I called the hotel GM ""Mark"" and left a detailed voicemail explaining the situation thinking he would call back and at least comp the room. No call back no nothing. I have over 200,000 Marriott rewards points and a black card. Super upsetting to say the least from a lifetime customer's perspective.... unreal.",hotel
"Lousy, people making noise couldn't sleep and the bed was really hard and the worse part was couldn't get in the Arcadia or anywhere else for dinner.Had to eat a hamburger from pegy sues.
",hotel
Noisy with street noise. Service was poor. Didn't even have bottled water in the room. The service phone would always be busy (had to call with cellphone) A bit pricey. Only good thing is proximity to convention center if you are attending conference there,hotel
"They overbooked the hotel and their idea of compensating the overbooked guests was to put us up in a 2 star(at best) motel. They didn't bother to even try to contact any of us ahead of time to let us know they misrepresented that rooms had been reserved for us. I travel a lot and will not spend another dime at any Marriott hotel. ""Reserve"" a room at this hotel at your own risk, but plan on staying at a motel with outside facing doors, window a/c units and lots of noise including police sirens, car alarms and people yelling in the middle of the night.",hotel
"The TV didn't work each time I turned it on. I had to call maintenance to get the signal to work. The excuse I got was that they were upgrading their Hi def. Room service was fact, pleasant and efficient. Service in the restaurant was pitiful. Pancakes were raw, the omlete was no where near what I requested. We sat next to a couple who said order beverage now because you can't be sure it will arrive. They asked 4x for juice and never got it.",hotel
"I am a fan of all Marriotts. I prefer to book with only big name hotels. However, I was disappointed with this one. I booked for 2/15 for a one night stay. Apparently, there were multiple weddings going on this day, as well as a volleyball tournament next door at the convention center. You would think that by the number of reservations this weekend, they would have planned to staff accordingly. WRONG. My boyfriend and I waited 45 FREAKING minutes to get valet service!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GAS I WASTED?!?!?! We were stuck in the valet traffic for THAT long and when we were finally helped, NO ONE apologized for the wait time. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! Although the hotel itself was nice and neat, the room was just OKAY. Our sink was clogged, and when it finally drained 20 minutes later, all the leftover residue of my boyfriend's shavings, my face wash, our toothpaste, and much more were left in the bowl. DISGUSTING! As we were getting ready for our night out on the town, we grabbed the ironing board. It plopped right over, because it was broken. Although the hotel itself was nice, and the location was good, I don't know if I would stay here again. Like I said, I've never experienced this at any other Marriott. In my opinion, service and cleanliness is what makes it or breaks it for me at a hotel. This specific Marriott broke it.",hotel
Never been to any Marriot Hotel and was expecting an above average experience. The view was amazing and the bed comfortable but room was not the cleanest and everything was an additional charge. Very overpriced and would not stay here again.,hotel
"My wife and I have stayed at this property previously over the past two years the last time a year ago and we rated it very highly. Unfortunately this trip with our child wasn't a good experience. We had booked and paid for a two bed Concierge room but arriving at the property was told there no two bed rooms were available - despite our pleading and paid reservation - but a Jr. Suite was available with a pull out sofa at the same price. First tip things weren't going to go too well. Walking down the hallway to the room we encountered duct tape (sorry about the dark pic) holding the hall carpet together. Tip #2. Entering the Jr. Suite we found that it was a handicapped room featuring a no-threshold shower with a short shower curtain. Tip #3 this was going to be a unpleasant experience. Showering flooded the entire bathroom floor. Then there was a cheerleading and volleyball tourney in the convention center which packed this property and the neighboring properties with way too many energetic young ladies bouncing around at all hours. Unfortunately since our stay a year ago, outside the lobby the property has significantly 'tired' from wallpaper seams starting to un-glue, banged up and heavily scuffed walls, faded common area carpet. Couple all the above with a less than helpful, uncaring check-in person with the coupe de grace of 2 day uncleaned vomit on the sidewalk next to the drive entrance and we most likely won't return. Behind the property is $7 overnight parking.",hotel
"At 1am there were people in the hall yelling, the cops arrived and were dealing with the situation until 3am. When I asked for a late check-out they told me no, even though they were not able to handle the chaos until 3:30am. I parked my car in valley, BIG MISTAKE!! It took an hour for me to get my car.",hotel
"The room was nice but there was some serious construction going on at the main entrance and also at the elevators, which made it difficult to get an elevator that went down to the first floor. The hotel seemed rather boring, there was really no way to tell where anything was, not great signage or advertising once you step in. The bathroom is really nice and big, and the shades they had in the room was really good at keeping the heat out when the sun was beating on that side of the building. The bed was comfortable, and the room is clean. We had room service to days in a row. Very average breakfast yet extremely expensive. Parking at the hotel is $31 per day, and if you don't like that you can go park somewhere else in the neighborhood for roughly the same price.",hotel
The hotel was nice but the services seem lacking. No breakfast is available unless you do room service. As we were there for a festival with tickets to various shows it was not possible to grab a sandwich or salad for lunch before a performance or schedule a family breakfast for 11 people on site. we had to leave the hotel and plan time to go elsewhere for simple things. The cost per night seemed high when there is no self parking and a $31 charge to valet per night.,hotel
"Nice hotel but for $400 a night I could have stayed somewhere more nicer. This would be a great place to stay on business but not for pleasure. The front desk also over charged my credit card bye over $1,0000 dollars and it effect my bank balance and we were unable to use our debit card for 2 days. This is completly unexceptable",hotel
I wish whole-heartedly I had been informed that I was staying during a convention. There were oddballs dressed up in every corner of the hotel. I had to walk down 23 flights of stairs because the elevators were so packed. It made for a terrible stay and it was honestly difficult to judge anything past that.,hotel
"When we walked into our room, it smelled like urine that someone had tried to cover up with room spray. I finally found the problem, in the corner, by the TV the carpet was coming up and brown as if someone had actually peed in the corner. Then the blackout curtains were two different lengths, one went to the ground and the other was short and let sunlight in. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to change rooms as the hotel was booked. I was really disappointed in the room and the quality of my stay. The smell made it hard to stay in the room for long periods of time and the curtain issue made it hard to sleep past sunrise. The location, however, was great, but next time I'm in San Jose, I would stay at the Hilton which is right beside the convention center and light rail as well.",hotel
"Comfortable hotel in the heart of the city It was my first time to go to San Jose with my family.We have chosen Marriot Hotel because of its's good reputations. We were not mistaken. The staff was courteous, competent & helpful. The room was impressive because of its's cleanliness, and it was also spacious, with a nice view of the surrounding buildings. We were able to get an extra bed to accommodate 4 people in the room.We had a wonderful stay in this hotel & I will recommend it to my friends.
",hotel
"Loved the hotel, but disappointed by the lack of services- dinner only room service and no poolside service.",hotel
The hotel was very conveniently located to the campus of San Jose State University and good dining areas. The down side was parking that was in the convention center and very uncomfortable pillows.,hotel
My co worker and I arrived at 11:00pm on a Sunday night. We went to a hair show at the convention center on Monday. We called and asked for a bottle of wine and were told that we were unable to get one. The bar wasn't closing until 12am. I think they could of been more accommodating. Other than that the room was clean and comfortable.,hotel
"SJ Marriott does many things well. Many long-time staff who are trained to provide excellent customer service are on hand. Common areas and room were clean and well-kept. Room size a bit on the small size, especially for the rather high price of the room. A complimentary bottle or two of water would have been much appreciated at this price point. Area is groovy and urban, lots of restaurants and convention center is connected via sky-walk.",hotel
The hotel was connected to the convention center which held wrestlemania convention. If it weren't for the convention we would not have known about wrestlemania and would not had attended. We had an excellent time!!! Excellent location!!,hotel
"Beautiful hotel with wonderful front desk and valet staff. The only down fall was housekeeping as they would always forget to replenish our towels. They would take the dirty ones and not give us any clean towels. Then when we would ask for towels they would give us one towel and two bath mats. So we'd have to call again. When they would drop it off they acted like they were doing us a favor. It would've been a favor if we were asking for extra towels, not the ones we should have had in the first place. This was the only reason I couldn't give them the excellent rating for room cleanliness and comfort.",hotel
"I chose this hotel due to the closeness to the San Jose Center for Performing Arts. There were other hotels also close to the venue. The room was typical hotel room with flat screen tv, mini frig, tea and coffee maker.Clean room, quiet. Once of pluses to this hotel is the restaurant ,Arcadia. A Michael Minna restaurant, Steakhouse. Great service,delicious food. I intend to try the restaurant for breakfast. There is only valet parking for $39, or you can use the public parking lot down the street. There is a gift shop/ mini mart/ coffee shop near the front desk. There is a charge for wi fi, but if you are a Marriott rewards member, it's free,",hotel
"Unexpectedly awesome, will stay here again. Great room, great staff and hi tech features of the hotel. Easy location close to the airport and right in the middle of town.",hotel
"Excellent location next to convention center. Had no difficulties -- no long elevator waits. Some of the exercise machines needed servicing, which was the only complaint I had. Hotel restaurant was very good.
",hotel
"Better than Episode VII, but that isn't saying much. Poorly written and directed, it doesn't really fit in the storyline with the original movies and actually ends up hurting them. This is what happens when you promise fans a new Star Wars movie every year. They don't have time (or take the time) to make a decent film. The only positives in this movie are a few funny lines and getting to watch a few Donnie Yen fighting scenes.",movie
"So incredibly boring and pointless. I laughed out loud when I saw CGI general tarkin, are they kidding me? Just unbelievable how they continue to basically rip off the originals and dangle shiny objects in front of us like we're cats, instead of making a serious and original Star Wars film. Rogue One is not a fun movie, I didn't really like Force Awakens but at least that one was more fun than this. This is just boring and totally and completely a waste of time.",movie
"When i was growing up in the late 70s star wars was my life. Everything I did was star wars, whether it was playing outside and pretending to be someone from star wars ~ the way kids in the 50s used to play cops and robbers or perhaps cowboys and Indians. If I was not outside playing star wars, then I was inside setting up star wars characters on one side of the room ~while my brother set up characters on the other side of the room- and we played this game with rubber bands and 3 pronged rules to shoot the rubber bands at them: last one with a star wars character standing wins.

Then in the 80s collecting all the cards and the cool toys. It was a boys dream come true. Well not anymore, star wars is all about some politically correct crap that I cant get behind nor care about. What took Luke years to master, took a woman hours, I guess their just better @ everything. And this movie, rouge one, was like watching a WW2 movie with star wars characters and star wars logos in it. Was like watching saving ryans privates meshed with star wars some how. Its just a fast pace non-thining pop corn movie.

Oh well, so much for good story telling. I miss you George Lucas, yes -Jar Jar binks was horrible and the ewoks too, but it was tolerable. Now its all about these new Disney movies with their non stop action (no time for a plot, tyvm) for the Ritalin raised kids now adults with attention deficit disorders. Meh, my time has passed, its yours now. Have fun with it, I know I did.",movie
"Easily the weakest film of the Star Wars series. Little character development, as DIsney knew beforehand the fates of everyone would ultimately be death, so they didn't flesh out the characters.
The only remotely redeeming factor of the movie is the end, that's it. Darth Vader's sequence is the only reason I won't petition Amazon for a 0-star review for this movie.",movie
"Not a good serial entry, like The Force Awakens. Travel is too fast. Only one interesting scene of the Death Star 1 battlestation's superlaser being lowered in to its crater. A female protagonist, much like Rey from TFA. Recreation in CGI of the long deceased actor Peter Cushing. Too much action and too juvenile of a plot. Disney acquisition. Uninteresting and unnecessary soundtrack.",movie
"So so, had too high expectations i guess. Darth Vador is the only reason to watch and last 5 min. Getting tired of the empowered female lead hollywood is doing to every movie. Just make a good movie instead of trying appease everyone. Soon they'll all be androgynous, transgender lead characters.",movie
"Hey, look, Lucasfilm has stepped up the special effects dept again...

Other than that, worst. ending. ever. I mean, seriously, total letdown. Not going to spoil it here - any internet search will turn up plenty.

Good acting from many, including a few no longer with us, but atrocious plot.

Worth a watch if you're a fan; doubt you'll need to see it twice. If you e seen the other movies, you pretty much know the core events.",movie
"As someone who watched the original Star Wars in the theatre probably 7 times, I never thought I'd say it, but didn't like this movie at all. The last movie with BB8 and the wonderful actors kept us entertained. This totally bored us. My daughter mentioned she shut it off and I just ignored her comment. Guess what we shut off mid way? Sure wasn't a normal Star Wars, it was so dry and long and dark. Did love the Robot with the attitude and the blind man. Wish more of those characters were in the movie.",movie
"Rogue One is completely unoriginal. This could have been a prequel that introduces an entirely new view of the Star Wars universe. This could have been mind-blowing science fiction. Instead, the film borrows heavily from previous franchise productions and also employs cliches from other classic movies- and TV shows. This is another plot about a daughter avenging her parent's death to right a wrong. We have the character of K-2SO that is basically 3CPO in a tall, lanky, cylon-like body. We have Master Po from Kung Fu incarnated into the character of Chirrut Imwe, the blind, Jedi master. The casting of Forest Whitaker and Jimmy Smits seemed jarring and almost silly. They are so recognizable that the performances seemed more like cameos. The mantra, ""I am one with the force and the force is with me,"" chanted during Chirrut Imwe's brave run to ""flip the lever"" and save the day, had me responding with ""Never give up, never surrender."" -And by the way, I'm confident that the real Master Po would have flipped that lever without ever going near it. There is a shot where our heroes are sneaking into the Imperial facility that looks eerily similar to the witch's castle in the Wizard of Oz complete with flying monkeys in the form of Imperial fighters. The penultimate cliche is when Jyn must transmit the Death Star plans by climbing an impossibly high, functionally ill-designed tower, replete with the 'bunch of choppy, crushy things"" Galaxy Quest's Gwen DeMarco despised so much. (SPOILER ALERT) Finally, the film concludes with all of the hero characters donning their ""red shirts"" to needlessly sacrifice themselves for ""hope."" What a disappointment.",movie
"To each his own, I was 3 when A NEW HOPE premiered, LOVE episodes 4, 5, AND 6.........CAN NOT COMPARE!!! tried VERY hard to tie in the others, plot....eehhhh... you can NEVER replace Carrie Fisher or the ORIGINAL Van Helsing, Peter Cushings.....the cadence of Vader was off, I LOVE James Earl Jones, I won't hate on him but, ""Disney"" CAN'T get this wright!!!!!",movie
"Even though its presented in 21:9, it is not native 21:9 (2560x1080) but is 1920x1080 with black bars making up much of that vertical 1080 resolution, black bars top and bottom, as well as left and right, unless you use the zoom feature on your 21:9 or wider TV or monitor... Many movies are native 21:9 format on Amazon, and it should be stated before you buy, whether it is or not.",movie
Typical corny virtual cartoon with loud chase and war scenes. Banality prominently displayed here in all the destruction and space war scenes. Not one of the best of the Star Wars series. I became bored with wasted time on the war scenes. I could leave the room and come back and not miss anything other than some computer generated graphic scenes for the sake of drama and loud music and sound effects. Choppy brief dialogue and over dramatize one liners.,movie
"The movie has its flaws and to be honest, if you're looking to purchase this you already saw this in the theater and have no need for a movie review. As far as bonus content goes it's the usual behind the scenes featurettes. Some of it is interesting and some of it is just the actors giving 'interview' answers for the puff pieces. There are no deleted or alternate scenes included like the bonus content included with the Force Awakens. I was very interested in seeing the alternate and deleted scenes that we all got a taste of in the trailers for this movie. Sadly they were not included in the digital HD version.",movie
"If I was going to write a movie between the 3rd and the 4th movie it would have, at some level, shown Vader killing off more Jedi and showing his power and the reason he is so feared in the 4th movie. When did Jedi start chanting? They are not wizards or witches so why are they chanting? I really thought the android and human interaction could have used more banter and some comic relief in this movie. For these reasons I rate this movie only 3 stars. Disney has yet to produce a star wars that episode that is impressive in cartoon or movie. It just isn't too great.",movie
"A reasonably entertaining movie, worth a view, but not the kind that I'll revisit repeatedly out of nostalgia for the franchise. Others will get into in-depth break downs of where this Star Wars themed war-movie went well and went wrong, but suffice to say, the cheese-factor inherent to the franchise here is largely masked by the grittier feel of thing.

While the blind warrior monk character was intriguing, as well as his touching friendship with the ""big-gun"" character, he felt abrasively shoe-horned in. The movements, choreography of his fights was too on the nose for a Chinese based action movie and honestly a bit of a distraction from the Star Wars theme. It was just a bit too ""earth 2016"" and distracted from the whole ""Galaxy far, far away."" The character himself was fantastic though, so worth the oversight imo.",movie
My husband is the star wars nerd of the family so by default I am forced to watch all of the newer movies as they come out. That being said I really enjoyed rogue one. I know some of the die hard fans complained about it being a different feel than the typical star wars movies - but I didnt see that and I could see very easily how this one tied in with the original plot line. We bought the disc set that came with the digital version since we mostly just watch things with our ROKU player and we were able to redeem this using amazon.,movie
"The special effects was good. i grew up with the first star wars movies. I thought those actors Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford etc... had a lot more chemistry with each other maybe they were better at acting than these new actors. You really loved the characters in those movies, not so much with this movie. Maybe it was better writing too.",movie
I liked the movie in the theater and listened to the audio book (which felt so drawn out) now the movie seems really rushed like they are rushing thru the scenes.,movie
"I love Star Wars and I love Rogue One. Why didn't you give it five stars, you ask? The CGI for Wilhuff Tarkin is just so bad it breaks you from your period of disbelief. I appreciate they took the effort to tie the original to this se-pre-quel, but it misses the mark every single time. Was that all? No. (Spoiler alert) the CGI for Princess Leia also is missing that human touch.

And all those cool shots in the trailers? Nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Jyn saying ""you're rebels. I rebel"" is missing. A Tie fighter appearing into frame with Jyn doing something awesome? Gone!

That being said, the story telling is fantastic. K-2SO steals every scene. The music is okay but it doesn't envelope you the way the original themes do. And of course there's the best scene, in my opinion, of the whole franchise!!! If you haven't seen it yet, just know Darth Vader is killer!!",movie
"I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but this was an interesting take on the mythos. It was nice to get back to the original look and feel of the movies (none of the ""Why does everything years before A New Hope look so much sleeker and cooler than the stuff that is supposedly 20-odd years later?""). And they deal well with the question of ""Why didn't any of these characters show up in A New Hope? (Basically, the only way they could. Genevieve O'Reilly plays a great Mon Mothma, originally played by Caroline Blackiston in ROTJ) And I like the fact that Disney seems to really have committed to solid female leads for the series, first in Force Awakens, and now in Rogue One. Now all we need is a story line that isn't a variant on ""A plucky band of misfits defeats enormous numerical odds against a galaxy-wide empire to blow up a really big thing.""",movie
"Rogue One, what do I say really?

This is a very different kind of movie than any other Star Wars movie has been to date. I grew up on the original trilogy, A New Hope came out right before I was born, so the movies literally resonated throughout my entire developmental cycle. Being a teen when the second trilogy started, or ""the prequels"" as they're more colloquially known, ""the trilogy that shall not be named"" by many more still, I was in my early twenties when the last of them released (Revenge of the Sith)... They were all terrible movies, frankly they were so bad I had kind of given up on the Star Wars IP ever really doing much for me again. And if you're one of those people that loves the prequel trilogy so much that my opinion offends you personally, move along, don't write a bunch of derisive, nasty stuff in the comments; you're the reason the internet is such a nasty place.

More adult offerings came about in the ""Knights of the Old Republic"" games, those ended poorly too when BIOWARE took their franchise into MMO territory... Then ""The Force Awakens"" came out, and I was trepidacious to say the least. However, I was pleasantly surprised with TFA, it contained a far more appealing (in terms of ""realism"") look at the empire and some serious room to develop into an appropriate successor to the original films. My primary complaint was that I was put off with Kylo Ren being such an unappealing and weak personality; though, in the end I could accept that from a psychological perspective they'd channeled the behavioral DNA of school shooter into the character, he's an emotionally unstable young man born to loving parents who were of impressive stature and tumultuous roots. He has lots of room to become something very dangerous and possibly rival Darth Maul, never Vader I would think though...

I digress.

After TFA I was genuinely intrigued at the prospects that Disney was opening the doors to with the direction they were allowing the Star Wars IP to drift.

Enter ""Rogue One"". I was not prepared. We went to see this opening night and I expected a silly, touching kind of sci-fi foray much like TFA; where in the end it was money well spent with some interesting ""over dinner"" conversation to have afterwards... I was wrong, I think everyone that went into this with that expectation had the same realization at some point. I was very genuinely moved several times during this movie, the way it's shot, it that plays out more like a WWII epic than a science fiction thriller, much less mindless action romp. I was amazed at the lack of Jedi, I actually clapped like a giddy kid at some of the cameos from A New Hope, and while it ebbs a little in the middle acts, as the conclusion nears, you're treated to one of the best space battles ever committed to film, and an ending that can't do anything but make you feel for everyone.

This isn't a simple feel good sci-fi movie, it's not a standard Star Wars offering, it's a very deep film that keeps the light heart of the franchise intact here and there, but underneath it is the most cohesive story telling and gripping material the SW universe has seen to date.

I can't recommend it enough for fans and newcomers alike. Amazing film, keep it up guys!

On a side note, for the people that were bothered by the Leia cameo at the end, relax, facial mapping they like they pulled off in this film is still largely new and labor intensive tech. I thought it was great that they included her.",movie
"I can't really find any flaws with this movie, and as an avid Star Wars fan I initially watched Rogue One with a critical eye. The director really knows Star Wars and the care he took in making this movie as he did shows that he truly loves the saga. It does its part to bring the film franchise back to its roots and has a character with the most 70s Star Wars name: Cassian Andor! I watched this in the theater with my mouth agape for most of it and could watch it over and over without ever getting tired of it.",movie
"I loved this Star Wars movie more than any other, with the exception of the first one released in 1977, Episode IV: A New Hope. It is exciting, thought provoking and so fun to watch all the puzzle pieces of the merging storylines come together. Masterfully created in my opinion and really takes me back to my childhood days. We saw it the day after Carrie Fisher passed and it was quite a tribute that led to a few tears in the last moments of the film.",movie
"Many Bothans died to bring you this review. The movie it self was done cinematic-ally well, the story line was well written and graphically it brought distant worlds right into your home.But this movie along with other Star Wars movies hold a deep place near to my heart. I can remember watching ""A New Hope"" eps IV with my father and mother at the drive in (yes I just aged myself LOL). So when this movie came out it brought back all those old feelings so for that alone I must give this 5 stars. But like I said it was also done as a proper Star Wars movie should be done.",movie
"I don't need to describe Star Wars obsession to any fan. I've had it since 1977. And after being so terribly disappointed in the three prequels, and really not loving The Force Awakens at all, I'm over the moon after watching Rogue One. Finally we got a Star Wars movie that is not geared towards children, or just resting on the laurels of the original trilogy. The stiff-looking Tarkin and Leia CGI aside, this movie thrilled me like Star Wars did as a kid - the action, the sly humor, the excitement, the hope, the tears. The universe in the movie feels enormous, and at the same time the visual and location details of all the worlds are so fine and well done that they feel real and tangible. I loved the movie, and I love the feeling I have after the movie. I look forward to many years of obsession with Rogue One.",movie

Will add photos for you to all can see it. Just looking them its enough to understand its not an iPhone 7.
It works very slow, the language is randomly changing between apps, it doesnt even have a good battery!
The serial number in the phone its not the same that the the one on the box.
Its not fair, I will find a way to return it because I dont live at USA.

"I have owned strictly androids, until I was forced into an iPhone for work. I have had a 5, 6s plus, and now, the 7. When I got so mad at the poor functionality of the 6, and after smashing and breaking it, i got the 7, thinking it was a superior phone. Well, compared even to the 6, and the horrible LG line up that they've had their entire time as a smart phone manufacturer, the 7 is literally a pile of garbage.

Here is what is right with it:
- The camera. It works. The 6 was better.

That's it. Here's what's wrong with it:
- Freezes randomly in the middle of a task
- Randomly closes me out of apps
- Not smooth, fluid functionality
- Voice to text is laughably worse than Android. Before the latest iOS update, that was one of the only things I preferred about the iPhone over an Android. Now, apple has nothing.
- Maps is a joke
- The home button is also a joke. In order to do a reset, you have to hold the power and volume down key, which in turn turns your volume down. Because that couldn't be programmed to operate differently.
- Who needs a headphone jack? Not the 7, apparently. Now you have to buy a separate $25 piece to listen to music.
- Overall cheap feel.
- Autocorrect. What? You typed ""of""? You obviously meant ""if"".

I could go on and on about how terrible this phone is. But, I think you get it. I have put in a request at work to get back into a 6, because of how terrible this phone is. Out of the nearly two dozen phones I've owned over my lifetime, this stands at my number one spot for worst phone available to major providers over the last 15 years. I have also been to the three major providers (Tmobile, att, and Verizon), and have had a huge array of different kinds of phones. I say with confidence, that this is the worst phone I have ever had the stress, and displeasure of using.

Buy at your own risk. These phones are terrible.",product
"The operating system is still not finished and it takes more than 10 minutes to establish a wi-fi connection. Whether at home or at the office or a public hot spot I find myself waiting for up to 15 minutes to get a WiFi data connection. Apple tech support people are clueless about networking devices and have recommended deleting all network connections which did not help or doing a full reset of the phone which wasted 2 days to download everything all over again and still did not help.

Updates are more than 1GB for the operating system and over 2GB for iTunes which is needed to do any sort of backup from the iPhone to a computer and Apple's trying to force everything through iTunes is as dumb a design as Microsoft's reliance on the registry.

Strongly recommend buying an Android OS based smartphone like the Pixel from Google. The Apple smartphone operating system leaves a lot to be desired if you want to connect to the internet or a local LAN and not rely 100% on cellular data with its high cost and slow speeds.",product
"Something wrong here.....Do your homework before you order from this seller...... there is something strange going on here. The phone arrived and would not accept the SIM card...the phone was already set up (weird....never seen this before) and would not accept the SIM card. Calls to AT&T revealed that the IMEI numbers don't match on the box and the phone.....these number must match.......AT&T tells me that the numbers I'm giving them are for an iPhone 6s Plus......not the iPhone7 that I have in my hand.....you think that's weird right? Me too.... the home button doesn't work and the whole thing is really strange.... something fishy going on here?!

The IMEI number MUST match the one on the phone.....MUST...... if u buy one of these from this seller.....your not doing ur homework. I sent mine back and drove straight to the nearest Apple Store

"I’ve had my IPhone 7 for close to a month now, and feel like I know it well enough to write a knowledgeable review of it. My previous phone was a BlackBerry Z30.
First I have to say is that I’ve been working at a factory on a 20 plus acre complex that employs about 700 people in Worcester MA for 6 years now. It is common knowledge among us, that the only carrier with a constantly reliable signal at this plant is AT&T.
That having been said, my Z30 could go on Verizon’s network with a signal anywhere from no signal to 2 bars of 4 G, with the average being about 1 bar of 3G, and no signal being more common than a 4 G signal.
The IPhone 7 is much worse. The range is between no signal to 1 bar of 3 G, the average being about 1 bar of 1X, and no signal being the most common of all. I could just shut it off, it’s that bad. I really didn’t know I had it so good with the Z30.
So, if you plan on using this phone in a weak signal area, I would recommend you get different phone, because this phone’s antenna is also weak!
Next is, I miss the BlackBerry Hub, all communications in one place. Phone, e-mail and messaging, all together in chronological order, or separate also in order.
I’ve installed Yahoo mail and get widgets of my e-mail on my home screen. Usually just one line of each new e-mails, but doesn’t get fully down-load it into e-mail app. So, if I’m at work and get an e-mail I want to read in its entirety, I have to wait for my hopefully 1 bar of 1X to do it. The Apple’s e-mail app was just as bad, it just doesn’t do the widgets. Not HAPPY! My old BlackBerry put everything into the hub without me asking for it to do it! When there was no signal, it would constantly look for one, and when it found one, it would do whatever was needed to be done. No input from me needed. It also had the battery power to do it all day. Happy with the IPhone battery so far.
I also don’t like that everything the IPhone does is cloud based, I get next to no signal 45 plus hours a week, the cloud is useless!
If I sound like I miss my old BlackBerry. I do, but I’m still trying my best to adjust to this IPhone. The jury is still out.",product
"I'm still offended by Apple playing the SLR card.

Even the iphone 6 at its 8MP actually looks better than the iphone 7 at 12MP for macros, and other outdoor shots.

The stabilization added in the 7 will help but in any form of action shot, it would be blurry and under low light indoors, all iphones are quite poor.

I doubt we'll see a xenon flash on the iphone 8, perhaps the 9? This of course leaves the Lumia 1020 pureview 41mp a superior shot and actually the stabilization is better there too. Alas, there is not always an app for that, with windows mobile.

If you have an older iphone, wait it out. Grab a pentax q-s1 for cheap and fun shots (along with a wifi SD card).",product
"The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology? Not quite.
This phone IS advanced but fragile. AppleCare and insurance is a necessity.
Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work.
I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!! Big bummer!!
It's not Steve Job's apple anymore but I can't see another device that appeals!!!",product
"The new iPhone 7 by apple is the best of the apple phones by far. Apple has added a few features to the phone such as the vibrating home button, a better camera with 14 mega pixels for the back and 7 mega pixels for the front. With not much change in the phone design but a few, apple stepped up with the software up date adding new texting feature and just giving the phone a new look software wise. But honestly when it comes down to it, the 7 is similar to the 6 in multiple ways and this makes me wish that apple would of done a better job at redesigning the new iPhone. I would recommend apple to anyone due to the dependability of their phones but keep in mind that with new releases of this phone might bring some disappointment.",product
"I just replaced my delicate ultra thin iPhone 7 after it fell from the dashboard onto the floor of my car. A mounting bracket that held it in place failed. The phone died. It had been protected with a thin plastic case. The iPhone 7 I use is supplied by my office, so I don't have a lot choice.

Our IT Department replaced the dead phone and provided a behemoth of a plastic a case to protect it. The new heavy case barely fits in my pocket

If this delicate flower of an iPhone 7 requires a massive plastic out case to survive ordinary use, perhaps Apple should reconsider it basic design.",product
"It's okay. I have been accustomed to using the 6S plus which has larger fonts and easy to type on. So for that reason I did not find it to good for me, but is is handy and small to travel with unlike the bigger one 6S plus.",product
"The long wait is over and the iPhone 7 is here any ready to be played with. The phone is very similar to the 6s model in the outside appearance. The phone itself is water resistant, but we noticed that it can be used completely under water without a case. The phone is very durable and can be dropped. After dropping it a few times, the screen is still together, not cracked or shattered. The battery life on the new 7 is very impressive, we can go an entire day without recharging.
Even thou on specs it shows that the 7 has much better hardware, I've noticed that it lags often and at times has no response what so ever for a few seconds.
The phone does not come with a head phone jack, sure most people have Bluetooth but when I'm sitting at an appointment waiting for the doctor, I usually don't have wireless headphone with me so can't watch YouTube or play games. The display looks exactly like the 6s, I cannot tell the difference with my eyes.
Overall I was expecting more from a $900 phone. I can give it only 3 stars as there are just not many new features and there are plenty of phones with much better specs at a fraction of the price.

"This did not work with a UK SIM or a Bermuda SIM. Went to Apple Store in London who said to activate iphone with an iTunes restore. This did not work either - message that the SIM carrier was not supported always appeared. After reading reviews on here bought a cheap AT&T SIM which seemed to activate the phone but still did not unlock it as it was still locked for using other country SIM cards. I requested an unlock code from AT&T website 2 days ago as a last ditch attempt. They replied today and said they had approved the unlock and to go ahead and activate the phone.
It now works with a non-U.S. SIM card finally so I am hoping it is unlocked for all GSM carriers worldwide.
So the phone I received was actually not international unlocked but locked on to AT&T - even though it was described as factory unlocked for use worldwide.By the way when I contacted the Amazon Supplier they were extremely unhelpful.",product
"I have to say, this is a good phone but it's basically a 6s without a phone jack. Same display as the 6s. The camera is better, so that's good news for camera peeps. Overall, the phone is getting the job done, but for the price, I'd say, if you already have a 6s, you can skip the 7 and save almost a $1000.",product
"Good : 1) dual lens zoom and 2) fingerprint sign in are more useful and convenient than I expected.

Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies. As a photographer/shutterbug, I was very disappointed. The so called 'natural' colors make pictures boring and ugly. Trees and grass have dull dirty green. Selfies skin tones are yellowish, brownish and unhealthy looking, like there's jaundice. Wrinkles are pronounced. Lens has a face widening, fattening effect. Lens distortion. For these reasons I am considering of selling my 7+ for a Samsung S8+. 7+'s Low light is terrific for a camera phone. But when I read it is DSLR level, nonsense. When other cameras phones give beautiful pictures, selfies, have beautifying software, iphone 7 is left in the dust. Pictures and selfies to many consumers are VERY important.

Minimal VR support. Another reason I am thinking of selling the phone for a Samsung. Even though Samsung is not a nice company.

7+ uses LCD screen when even my mid range Samsung J7 has OLED and much deeper blacks. Iphone 7+ screen is beautiful but the blacks are not as deep.

Not much technological and design innovation. Just a nice 'luxury' item. Apple needs to up their game.",product

The phone is top notch. One of the speakers on the bottom doesn't work but it's really a non issue for me. Otherwise the phone was basically new. The homies that shipped it send it with some candy and a granola bar so that was pretty dope.,product
" have both iPhone 6s and 7 and see some improvements.

The iPhone 7 is almost identical to the iPhone 6s, but as we all know, lacks headphone jack.

The improvements, that I’ve noticed so far are:

- better battery life
- slightly better photos (especially the ones in low light)
- faster processor
- water-resistant
- brighter screen
- louder sound

The thing that took me a while to get used to is a new home button that is not ‘clickable’ anymore. I must say I preferred the old button. Now, I have the feeling that the click is happening ‘inside’ the Phone, rather than on its surface.
It works perfectly well though.

The lack of a headphone jack is a small con for now, since there’s no many lightning-compatible headphones yet. I hate the dongle so decided on buying the new headphones.

They are pricey, but work great. When testing Siri( turns on after double tapping on the earpiece), they pick up voice pretty well, although I tried to speak very clearly.
What is interesting, the audio pauses when you pop a headphone out when talking to someone - pretty nice feature.
The AirPods’ battery lasts for 5-6 h of continuous use, although the voice calls use more energy.
I’d recommend getting ones, since their quality is pretty good and they are easy to charge and store ( come with a case that recharges the pieces). The disadvantage is obviously the price… They’re also easy to loose.

Forget about using wired headphones and charging in the same time… Unless you want to get another adapter, that will give you 2 lightning ports… ( Offered by Belkin)

About the water resistivity:

That feature wasn’t meant to be tested but I accidentally dropped my phone to a sink with running water and it surviver…I wouldn’t recommend washing your phone when it gets dirty though…

Camera:

Unfortunately, the iPhone7 doesn’t have the second lens( as the iPhone plus has), The selfie camera was improved though, and I see a difference between evening photos taken with iPhone 6s and 7.

The sound:

Significantly louder, stereo. (Could hear the music while doing my dishes).

The battery:

The new battery is much better. I can listen to the music almost all day long, browse the internet for a few hours, make couple of calls and use other apps without charging my iPhone7 in the middle of the day.
I also noticed that it takes less to fully charge the phone.

The Phone performance is quite faster. I feel it while editing pictures or playing games and stream music in the same time.

Overall, I’m happy with the purchase even though I have iPhone 6s. The battery life, sound and water resistivity were convincing enough to give a new model a try.

The con is that you must spend additional money on headphones (unless you want to use bangle or Lightning EarPods). The Apple’s wireless headphones are expensive, but definitely high quality.

I am attaching a comparison between picture taken with iPhone 6 and 7.",product
"Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone.",product
Not an insane improvement over the 6 but the addition of water resistance is great (and long overdue). I'm not a fan of the omission of the headphone jack. This is especially an issue when you want to use the adapter to use your own headphones but also want to charge the phone at the same time (i.e. long flight while watching movies). There is an adapter that will allow headphones AND charge at the same time (and this is what Apple should of included with the phone) you can check it out here: http://amzn.to/2cutG5W,product
"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6s

Camera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.

SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.

Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.

I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.

Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!

Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.

128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.

No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.

IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.

No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.

Hope this helps :)",product
"I got this as a gamble. Its hard to buy a phone online, but i read the reviews and everyone else seemed pretty pleased. I got the phone pretty quickly, opened it up, and it was exactly as described. Looked pretty much like a brand new phone and functions perfectly. I saved a lot of money and got a great deal.",product
"What can I say? Fantastic updated version of the iPhone. Everything I expected and more. Ordered the unlocked int'l version in order to use it in Iceland and it works very fine. Brilliant camera. Also, recommend buying the waterproof case for taking pics on the beach or in the aqua parks, has come in handy on our honeymoon in the Canary Islands.",product
"I've been using this since 9/16/16 and here's my everyday person impression:

GOOD:
+ water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me!
+increased speed is noticeable w Siri.
+the capacity is amazing! (I have the 256) I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee).
+ decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket.
+Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing.
+has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip.
+camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability.
+has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin.
+the style and sleekness of the new Jet Black option is a thing of beauty. It's almost criminal to cover it (but necessary for me).
+even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing.
+speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still).

BAD:
- no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones.
-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Is it worth the extra money? I'm not so sure but despite the two drawbacks, which I think are a temporary, I'm loving the features and ease of the iPhone 7 and the Jet Black is beyond elegant and sleek. I will provide update after continued usage.",product
"I'm back and it's better than ever

I was in the market for a new phone, and decided since it was the actual launch day, I'd go down to my ATT store and purchase something. I wasn't sure that I would purchase an iPhone 7 (honestly, about 80 percent sure I would) and I waited in line. The whole actual waiting part wasn't as tremendously large as it's quoted as being. I really didn't have to wait all that long, which I think is in part to a lot of people not seeing the potential in this phone.

After I purchased the phone, I immediately went and got a Charging case from the same store. This not only allows me to charge my phone, but use my headphones at the same time. I don't have a need for headphones that I can lose (AIRPODS) and I like that Apple actually gives an alternative to you, you get to use corded earpods, and if your battery case is charged (essentially an external battery), you have about 1-2 days of full fledge battery life (and I use my phone a lot) and can still use the headphones.

The speed of this one is what amazed me to be totally honest with you. I'm coming back to Apple after a small break and using a GoPhone (ZTE MAVEN) on the postpaid service. The Maven did well honestly, and I kept it around for a lot longer than I usually do. It just worked, and that can't be said for most phones. I'd experimented with iOS10 with my iPad, but I can say, it works a lot better on this than the iPad. Games, videos, even texting, are so much faster, it's hard to believe. The Digital Touch message feature is a nice touch, however, how much I'll use it I've yet to see.

Having no physical home button is not a ""biggie"" to me. There is a haptic feedback button in place of this, which is essentially a touch sensitive button, but it actually has a feeling as though you're pressing it. It's kind of how the trackpad works on the MacBooks. A nice touch. It took a little bit to get used to, and choose the ""touch"" I wanted, but after doing so, it's been easy.

I'm not displeased as many people would think about the headphone issue, as many people are. I use headphones, but so long as there is a workaround, which Apple has done, I'm not bothered. I can still use the earpods with the lightning connector. I guess it would be an inconvenience to you if your battery-case (if you bought one, or buy one) is dead, and I can actually see that being an issue. But this is why you need to watch battery levels.

The camera is EXCELLENT. I've been a photographer for the better part of my life, and can leave my Nikon at home and walk out with this and be confident that any shots I need to take, can be taken with this. HDR is a must.

Sound quality with this unit is very good, however, I must say, if you have a screen protector on the phone, you can legitimately feel the sound coming thru the speakers, thru the screen protector. Every phone that has had a screen protector that I've tested on the iPhone 7, has had this issue. All of the floor models that don't are fine. It doesn't bother me tremendously, but for a high end phone, you'd think that design would have been looked at before the phone was released.

Overall, I'm pleased, and I think I will be for the foreseeable future. But I usually love almost every phone that I've owned, so, I'm not sure how biased I actually might be. As the experience continues, I'll be sure to update my review with any updates that would be beneficial.",product
"You must be kidding with this place. Came because of some reviews.... which is a statement to the fact that you cant rely on reviews alone. Feels like sitting around with the bar crowd still there from the night before.... 

Place smells like old bar smell.... So why didn't we walk out? The reviews, people were nice and the menu was intriguing so had to stick it out. Benefit of the doubt sort of thing. 

Ordered the Classic Benedict which actually came out as ONE EGG Benedict.... Benedict Arnold.... owner - Tell me, what is ""classic"" about a single egg  on half an English muffin? What do you do with the other half??? Asked waitress who said they used to serve two but because of the size - bigger... they went to one... um... there was one standard egg on a regular muffin... what is bigger except the ham was thicker sliced... ? Seriously?? Served with the most dismal dollop of hash browns.... coffee - forget about it... rancid stuff.  13 bucks for half a benny? Cmon...

So, from professional chef to another and the owner, .... what the hell? Never again. Going to the hen house up the street.. cheers!",restaurant
"This place was good year's ago and now I think it's made the owner's head to big to notice that he has folks working for him that don't treat the customers right and can't get orders right either.  This really ruined my experience at this place.  Food was good, but it came super late and wrong.  The waiter, who did not write anything down, tried to tell me what I ordered in a very snotty matter and I did not appreciate that.  He also told me that because they he had to change the order it would take longer. LONGER?!!  He mentioned that he had been there for 17 years, but methinks he needs a new career as our experience was a disaster!!",restaurant
"This place was absolutely terrible.  Went to dinner here last Monday night with my son and neither of us barely touched our food.  I had fish and chips (walleye)...who can screw that up?  OMG...it was the worst fish I have ever eaten.  The breeding was a quarter inch thick and way over done...the flavor was bad too.  Ok, put the fish aside for a minute...can you say COLD sweet potato fries.  My son's regular fries were also cold, and his French dip was soggy and cold.

Totally not sure how this place gets 4 stars, but you couldn't pay me to eat in this basement ""hell hole"" again!",restaurant
"Well. Was very optimistic due to all of the other reviews, so we eagerly went this am. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. First we sat for nearly 10 minutes before being greeted by a server. It was not very busy. The menu was interesting, but for a breakfast place, they are trying a little too hard to be eclectic for eclectic's sake. The coffee was not very good. I ordered the huevos rancheros with the pulled pork. Sounded amazing.  Was not. Was lukewarm and not very savory. My wife got the veggie omelet which was advertised with jalapeños, tomatoes and onion. Good enough. Yuck. It came out with undercooked butternut squash and large pieces of undercooked carrot. In an omelet. Ewww. Who eats that? Root veggies in an omelet? The waitress apparently thought it was a mistake, but when the manager came out he simply threw the waitress under the bus and said it was her fault. Still not sure why. But when we asked him if we could simply have an omelet with tomato and peppers, he said we couldn't because of they way they prepare. Really? A restaurant that clearly has tomatoes and peppers and clearly makes omelets couldn't make one with tomatoes and peppers? Find that very disappointing. Not sure what all of the god reviews were from. Our experience was much less than spectacular.",restaurant
"I suspect someone complained about seeing the slightest hint of pink in a burger once, because even if you order medium rare you'll get well-done. Poor, inattentive service from the staff (across the board, not just our waiter). The supposedly infamous homemade peanut butter is just peanut butter that's made of actual peanuts (no sugars added) - you can find this at any Whole Foods. It's nothing to come here for. 

Other dishes at the table lacked flavor and were greasy. This place is nothing special, which is disappointing after seeing over a thousand positive reviews.",restaurant
"I came here for breakfast, as Hell's Kitchen was one of the few restaurants near where I was staying that serves breakfast on the weekdays.

The place is massive.  There are two floors and the restaurant is very spacious - perfect for private parties and large groups.  I was seated immediately on a Monday morning in a dining area where there were a few other groups dining in.  My server was very friendly and helpful - and service was good. 

But the food was unsatisfactory.  I ordered the Bison Egg Benedict and substituted the hashbrowns for a mixed greens salad.  The bison benedict was drowning in the lukewarm jalapeno-hollandaise sauce, so was hard to eat, but I was mostly disappointed with the bison itself.  The menu indicated that it would be cooked to medium-rare, which is how I prefer my meat, but it unfortunately, was overcooked - so the texture was rough to cut and chew.  I was not impressed.  At least the poached egg had that runny yolk once I cut into it, and did like the greens with a pear vinaigrette, making the dish lighter.  But I would not recommend this dish, given the overcooked bison, drenched in the hollandaise sauce.      

Glad they have a breakfast menu on the weekdays, but can't say I'd willingly come back.",restaurant
"Went for dinner with a coworker. Arrived at 7:10pm. Told 20min wait and gave phone number as they text when table ready which kind of cool. Tried to fine sweat at bar but no luck as everyone wanted to keep a coat or purse on the stool next to them and not the hooks provided. 20min found 2 open stools. Meanwhile counted 7 booths open and a few tables so they were trying to slow things as kitchen was slammed with what seems to be 50% full. Was able to get a drink after 10m. After 35 got the text table ready. Was walked past several 4 tops and booth and shoved in a small 2 top for 2 guys, was like really and they said this is what they had. Already hungry we took it. 

I got Cesar salad and the Jamaican pork chop cooked medium.  Salad was ok, not sure why tomato was in a Cesar but ok. Chop came and first 1/2 was okay. Not really jerk. Mashed were like warm and veggies cooked to mush. 

Wasn't until most the way through the chop I noticed it was RARE at best. Showed server and was told ""oh rare poke I eat all that time."" No concern, no management visited, no nothing other then ""do you want desert"". 

Glad I'm just visiting here as I know I'll never have to go back.",restaurant
"While decidedly not the worst dining experience of my Twin Cities trip, I'm left scratching my head in confusion as to how this establishment is so highly rated. The food quality is well below average, though prices are on the opposite side of the spectrum. I think the soft factors are solid: the seating is comfortable, the service was pleasant, and many items can be ordered in smaller portions so that you can try a variety of items. If you like live music (I do not, and wasn't expecting any, so it was a most unwelcome surprise), they have that too, even at 10 AM on the weekends, and they seem to make passable picks (the surprisingly solid Johnny Cash cover band Church of Cash when we visited). Still, what matters most about a restaurant is food quality, and on that front, Hell's Kitchen falls decidedly short. 

For my late breakfast, I ordered the corned beef hash & eggs. The plate consisted of two eggs (poached in my case), a small pile of pulled corned beef, a somewhat larger amount of ""hash,"" what I think was a green garnish, and toast. Of the eggs, one was correctly poached, though the other had an overly firm yolk center. Still, they may have been the best part of the plate, if only because of how lacking everything else was. Setting aside the oddness of their choice to pull rather than dice the corned beef, I found it to be so oversalted as to border on inedible. Of course, there was only really about four bites worth of corned beef, so there wasn't much to leave unfinished. What they call hash is unlike any hash I've ever had, and in this case, novelty is certainly not a plus. I enjoy celery as much as the next man, but I have zero idea why they opted to have large chunks of it in the hash. It isn't every day that you have a hash with enough else going on that the potatoes fade into obscurity, though they managed that first as well. And the pile of mixed greens in one corner? I don't know if it was meant to add visual appeal, in which case it failed miserably, or to round out the plate by including an (accidentally?) undressed salad that nobody would ever want, but I can think of zero reason for its presence other than visual trickery, to help disguise the very tiny portions of the dish's listed core elements.

Taking up the last half of the plate were two slices of toast. Normally you have a choice of sourdough or multigrain, though for an upcharge you can replace it with their sausage bread. Curious to try one of their ""MN icon"" dishes (as designated by their menu), I rolled the dice and ordered it. It is dense, almost more like banana bread or other dessert loaves than standard stock, but nowhere in that density was flavor to be found. I'd never know there was any sausage but for the name, and the walnuts and currants among other ingredients are evident more from the texture than the taste. I tried adding their made-in-house peanut butter they love to advertise, and found it improved the toast, but only marginally, because it was a below average spread that you'd never reach for in a grocery store. 

I managed to try their two other toast toppings - blackberry ginger jam and orange marmalade - on a couple of regular slices of toast and found them even more forgettable. I also tried the parmesan garlic tots that had been ordered for the table, and in keeping with the prior theme of ""impossibly overseasoned or impressively bland,"" found them to be intolerably excessive in their use of garlic. I love garlic, usually even in copious quantities. But the level here bordered on weaponization. 

Still hungry from my undersized and overpriced breakfast, I decided to give Angel Bakery, owned and operated by the same people and located just one level above, a shot at redeeming them. I ordered the Zee German, a donut with nutella icing, crushed pretzels, and a chocolate drizzle. To their very modest credit, it was better than the trashworthy donuts being sold by Cardigan in the Skyway, but still thoroughly unworthy of the calories. I've never had such flavorless nutella icing, and the pretzel garnish tasted stale. A truly unsatisfying end to an already profoundly unpleasant meal.",restaurant
"I write this review with a heavy heart. I absolutely love the food here; the sauce served with our cheese curds last night was dynamite! However the last two times I have dined here I have had a terrible time. 
Both times I made reservations. 
The first time I had made a reservation months in advance for Valentine's day, yet was seated within elbow's length on both sides between other patrons. It was not at all an intimate dinner, as we could hear the conversation from both of the tables beside us. Perhaps this is ""to be expected,"" for that day but one should always hope for the best especially when time was taken towards preparation. 
The second time we were seated with our menus for near twenty minutes before our server even came to get our drink order. Not even an acknowledgement from our server or any of the staff, a ""just a moment,"" would have been sufficient for me to dismiss it as them just being busy. I've worked in the customer service industry for years and I'm just baffled. Just to top that off my hotcakes were served without a fork.  
This is quite unfortunate as I so enjoy the food and never had any bad experiences at the now closed Duluth location. It needs to be said, however,  I have never felt so ignored in a restaurant.

TL;DR: The food is delicious, the live band was great, but the service is lousy; and personally due to these experiences I've dubbed ""Hell's Kitchen"" as simply not worth the drive.",restaurant
"Every year we head to Minneapolis to spend some time with our daughter and hang out in the city. One of the things we always like to do is to stay right down town and eat at the various restaurants in the area. Hell's kitchen has always been on our favorites for breakfast. However, this year we we're quite disappointed. Almost to a point where I'm not sure we'll return. First, perhaps I was us having a Sr moment but the menu seemed to be a bit more limited that what I remembered as far as the selection of breakfast dishes. The food we did order was OK, I ordered the 'Nearly Classic Eggs Benedict' , which as an FYI is only 1, not two, Perhaps this is the 'nearly' part I didn't pay attention too. Going back and looking at the menu it does say this so that's on me.... Anyway, the food was Luke warm at best and the egg was effectively 'hard' and over done. Now, many will say, why didn't you let them know this... Ok, again, it's on me for that but first of all, I was very hungry and it took a long time to get. Second, I have some paranoia of sending food back. Third, our server, could not have been more unfriendly so at that point we just wanted to finish up and get on with our day. We should have picked up on what our experience was going to be right from the beginning when we sat down. We we're greeted with a ""you want something to drink...."". Not good morning, could I get you something to drink.... Seemed real uninvited from the beginning.Again, not sure what the protocol would have been at that point, ask for a different server? Moving on, we had to ask for a few things we normally just get when we've visited before, like more coffee, the peanut butter and jam, small stuff I know. As you can see from my previous post I don't review a lot and I really hate to even write this because it really seems like a stupid 'first world' issue but I guess I felt if your going to pay $40-50 for a breakfast for 2 you should probably feel good about it when you leave. Unfortunately, not the case.",restaurant
"I had everything on the menu, the pancakes, the omelet, the crab benedict, the hamburger with peanut butter, the state fair cheese curds, the drinks, almost everything that yelpers and facebookers recommended and I just wasn't impressed.  I think I placed my expectations higher than it should have and left extremely disappointed.  There was nothing memorable about my two visits here except for the great service and the hospitality that I received when I was there.  I won't sway anyone from visiting this restaurant but I was just not all that impressed.  Visit for yourself and come to your own conclusion about this popular restaurant.",restaurant
"Meh, I really wanted to love this place but just couldn't. 

I ordered the Juicy Lucifer, medium with tots and a side salad. This sounded amazing but turned out to be less that remarkable. The burger was a little overcooked but not to horribly, however the burger was extremely dry. This I couldn't understand since it was jam packed with cheese. But never the less it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth and was less than enjoyable. The salad was really good yet simple and the tots never showed up to the table. I gave up on asking.

Beer selection was pretty good and a few others had cocktails within our party and were satisfied. If the burger wasn't $15 and pretty bad I probably would have gave them 4 stars as the building is very interesting and so is the staff.",restaurant
"Positives -- quick service and breakfast served all day. Juicy Lucifer is a must try. Great atmosphere. 
Negatives - lemon ricotta pancakes made me sick. I'm going to guess this is a one off because my colleagues enjoyed their food and did not get ill. Overall I would try it again if in Minneapolis",restaurant
"Work lunch! So automatically this review is at a disadvantage because I would have rather been somewhere else, with other people. 

Nonetheless.... the menu looked promising. Oooh lemon pancakes! Alas, a work lunch. The others order salads, so what kind of professional would I be if I got pancakes!? So I made the mature choice and went with a grilled panini with pear or apple (couldn't tell) and some kind of white cheese. Which was okay.I didn't think it was anything special and I would not get it again. 

Service was prompt. The place is cool and I can see why people like it. I think I just made a bad choice. (Note: if there are bad choices on the menu, selection should be thinned down so everything they do is good. Jussayin.)",restaurant
"The door man of the hotel recommended this place. It was noon and I had slept in, worked out and wanted coffee and breakfast. He said they serve breakfast late and it was only a few blocks from my hotel. 

You walk downstairs to a dark room. It's got a cool vibe to it and in the restaurant I sat next to a stage and on the screen they were showing cartoons. 

I was in desperate need of coffee and the waiter served that right away. I love eggs benedicts. Here you only get one so you have to upgrade if you want too. I thought it was a bit expensive for two eggs. I think I've gotten into the habit of comparing my bene's to Snooze in Denver. These were good but not in the ranking of my favorite bene's. The service was great and he offered a lot of coffee re-fills.",restaurant
"Must-visit spot while in Minneapolis.

I enjoyed the theme and ambiance. Food was really good also.

We went at around 12pm brunch time on a Sunday on the weekend before Halloween!

Perfect, perfect, perfect all around. We enjoyed the live music.

We had the MN icons - Walleye hash, ham & pear crips and lemon-ricotta hotcake. We had the jacked up bloody mary as well. Just had to try it all.

The walleye is iconic for the area so we're glad to got to try a taste of Minnesota. This was a highlight for us. We really enjoyed the cream sauce!

The framed portraits in the bathroom were quite freaky... for me at least.

The bloody mary/mimosa bar is an experience in itself. Note for shrimp lovers that there's shrimp at the end of the bloody mary bar so make sure you make room for it in your mug. My bloody mary turned out awesome but I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you put in your glass!

Great place. I'm glad we went.",restaurant
"Quirky. Tasty. Friendly. Solid service with creative eats and a fun, upbeat ambiance. For Bostonians, this is Beehive meets Lolita, with better food and lesser drinks. 

HK is also chock full of things you must eat before you die, including:

In-house crunchy peanut butter (with berry jam for maximum impact

BisonSausagePattyThingFromHeaven

Hash browns crunchier than Ståle Rice Krispies on 30 seconds of milk dip. 

Bloody Mary / Mimosa bar is impressive but adds up quickly and like a carnival ride only one person per table needs to get on. 

Live music is upbeat. Patrons colorful. Decor a mashup of Poe and the Angels & Demons set. 

Great stop for unique fare, good service right in downtown Minneapolis.",restaurant
"Hell's Kitchen is definitely a popular destination to grab a meal downtown Minneapolis for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Tried their Original crack power salad for brunch and absolutely loved it! A friend of mine recommended it and told me that the original crack salad was super popular so I was excited to try it. It was so refreshing and wholesome.
I saw the intense Bloody Mary line and opted for a Mimosa to complement my salad.

On other occasions I have had their Quesadilla was super yummy. I will say I am not fan of their homemade ketchup. They don't  have regular ketchup so I dealt with the homemade option on that one instance.

Love their partner pastry shop, Angel food bakery that is right next door.",restaurant
"Tried this spot after the  Vikings game this past weekend on the recommendation of a friend who raved about it. And it didn't disappoint. Cool spot underground in downtown Minneapolis. We sat on the bar side. Really cool décor. They have a good tap selection of local Minnesota craft beers, and a special ""secret beer"" for $2 each day where you don't know what you are getting until it is served. My buddy Bob tried ordering it but was swayed not to by our waiter as he noted ""it wasn't very good and your not going to like it"". Cheers to honesty!

I had a pint of the Summit Brewing seasonal and went for the Ham & Pear Crisp Sandwich with a side of tater tots. So good. The website menu description says it all: "" Featured in ""50 Best Sandwiches in America."" Shaved, slow-roasted smoked pit ham, poached pears, melted Swiss and Fontina cheese on spicy-sweet buttered & grilled sourdough bread."". It was fantastic. Their homemade ketchup was amazing for dipping the perfectly crispy tots, although their homemade hot sauce lacked any sort of heat which was a tad odd for a sauce named ""Bottled Hell"" made at a place called ""Hells Kitchen"".

Great service, cool spot, good food. What more do you want?",restaurant
"Make sure you get reservations! This place gets really crowded. I had the Walleye BLT and shared the lemon ricotta hotcakes. The Walleye BLT was great and HUGE. Nice crunch on the flaky fish, bacon was perfectly cooked, and the sourdough was a nice starch to tie it all together. I was not a fan of the lemon ricotta hotcakes. It was dense.. way too much ricotta; not the light fluffy pancakes I typically enjoy. Overall, a decent place to grab lunch!",restaurant
"What a fun, funky, fantastic place! In Minneapolis for business and kept hearing rumors of Hell's Kitchen (not to be mistaken for Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen).

You walk down into a basement where you are immediately hit with all kinds of fun, quirky decor.

We started off with the tater tots served with blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, hot sauce and ketchup. YUMMO

My colleague had the Juicy Lucifer (Juicy Lucy) which apparently MN is known for their cheese stuffed hamburger....he was kind enough to share 1/2 with me...talk about Juicy and outright delicious!!! 

I had the filet mignon (shared 1/2 with my colleague, of course) served with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes.... all cooked and flavored to perfection.

Paired with a glass of red wine...super pleased with the meal, the wait staff and the ambiance.",restaurant
"Super pleased with our visit here mostly because of our server (Shannon)

We sat by the bar and were served promptly by her.  My wife is an extremely picky (annoying) eater and went through painstaking detail trying to configure her meal. Shannon hung in there through the bitter end never once exhibited frustration, confusion or hurrying her to wrap it up.  She was pleasant, friendly, positive and fun.  

The staff can make or break your experience in a restaurant...this was evidenced by our visit to Hell's Kitchen...it left us with a very favorable view of the restaurant, the city and its people.",restaurant
"I took a bite of the devil's food and now I'm glad to join the dark side. 

Okay, enough metaphors. I picked this restaurant on a blip because I was craving a good burger. The restaurant is located inside a building basement, which seem to be fitting the name's theme. The atmosphere is nice without going too much for the sake of the novelty of the name ""Hell's kitchen"". The service was friendly and timely though it looks like they can get overwhelmed pretty quickly. The wait time was decent, with a large waiting place for you to hang out and order drinks from. 

I had the standard Juicy Lucifer burger with sweet potato fries. It was one of the best SPF I had. It wasn't too sweet, which is to my liking. It comes with a pepper jelly which is on the sweeter side of chili pepper and it was highly recommended. The molten cheese almost caught me off guard but it was a satisfying lip burn. I smothered the jelly across my plate rather than dipping it. I think it's a great technique than just putting on your burger. Because of how incredibly awkward the burger stack is (the patty was almost egg shape), I ate with a fork and knife, which is fine. Hell's Kitchen is a recommended visit for Minneapolis.",restaurant
"Wow...is what my wife and I think about this place. We were walking around the downtown area a stumbled across this place and decided to give them a shot and we defiantly made the right choice.  I order the French dip and fried cheese curds and my wife ordered the walleye tacos. My French did was flavored perfectly and the cheese curds were awesome...on problem was my wife was stealing them off my plate! The walleye tacos were amazing. They had a beautiful balance of sweet, salty, spicy and tartness. They were well rounded and difficult to stop eating. I wanted to go back the next day, but we decided to give another restaurant a shot...I wish we went back! Staff was was great, our server gave us the perfect amount of attention!

"Not the Hell's Kitchen you think it is.

Be prepared to take yourself away from heaven and enter below the tunnel to Hell. The decor will constantly remind you of all the sins you've made. With the addition of live music, it feels as if your sins are coming alive. As creepy and cool this place is, the food is what brings you back to life. 

On to the food, the locals were right. Hell's Kitchen has the best food.

Pan fried walleye with veggies and mashed potatoes. 
Lemon ricotta pancake.

Walleye was on point and the veggies and mashed potatoes were delish. The dish was simple but the flavors were deep. Their famous lemon ricotta pancake was fluffy and sweet and filled with delightful fruits. 

I'm pretty glad there was no Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen. 

Double thumbs up for breakfast, brunch, dinner, happy hour, or games.",restaurant
